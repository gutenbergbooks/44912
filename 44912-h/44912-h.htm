<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>William Wilberforce is remembered on account
of his long and successful efforts for the Abolition
of the Slave Trade. In a House of Commons
that counted Pitt, Fox, Burke, and Sheridan
amongst its members, he held a front rank
both as a speaker and debater. Of one of his
speeches in 1789 Burke said, "it equalled anything
he had heard in modern times, and was not,
perhaps, to be surpassed in the remains of Grecian
eloquence." And Pitt said, "Of all the men I
ever knew Wilberforce has the greatest natural
eloquence." But an even greater power than his
oratory was perhaps the influence that he acquired
over all ranks of society. Friendship is often the
means by which influence is gained, and Wilberforce's
friendship with Pitt, beginning long before
his anti-Slave Trade days and continued till the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
end of Pitt's life, was no doubt the source of a
strong personal influence.</p>

<p>It has been said that nothing in history is more
creditable and interesting than Pitt's long and
brotherly intimacy with Wilberforce, widely as they
differed in their views of life.</p>

<p>To give an idea of the terms of their friendship
these letters, possibly mislaid by the biographers
of Wilberforce, from Pitt to Wilberforce are now
published.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Lord Rosebery thought the letters "among the
most interesting we possess of Pitt," and we gladly
acceded to his wish to print a few copies privately.</p>

<p>The Rev. W. F. Wilberforce has kindly consented
to the publication of the matured estimate
of Pitt's character mentioned in the "Life of Wilberforce,"
with an intimation that "it might hereafter
appear in a separate form."</p>

<p>Other letters from some of the most distinguished
men of the time show the many and varied interests
of Wilberforce's life, and seem to us too valuable
to remain hidden in obscurity.</p>

<p>The home letters published are from Wilberforce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
to his daughter Elizabeth, and to his son
Samuel, afterwards Bishop of Oxford and Winchester.
The letters to the latter are from the
collection of 600 letters written by the father to
the son.</p>

<p class="big center">LETTERS FROM PITT.</p>


<p>THE first of Pitt's letters to Wilberforce is "perhaps
the only one extant that is racy of those rollicking
times when the 'fruits of Pitt's earlier rising'
appeared in the careful sowing of the garden beds
with the fragments of Ryder's opera hat."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Grafton Street</span>,<br />
"<i>July 31, 1782</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Wilberforce</span>,&mdash;I shall not have the least
difficulty in applying immediately to Lord Shelburne
in behalf of your friend Mr. Thompson, and the
favour is not such as to require a great exertion of
interest, if there has been no prior engagement. I
will let you know the result as soon as I can. Pray
have no delicacy in mentioning to me whatever
occurs of any kind in which I can be of any use to
you. Whenever there is anything to prevent my
doing as I should wish in consequence, I will tell
you, so we shall be upon fair terms. I trust you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
find all possible advantage from sea-bathing and
sea-air.... I am as well as it is possible in the
midst of all this <i>sin and sea coal</i>, and, for a
Chancellor of the Exchequer who has exchanged
his <i>happier hour</i>, pass my time very tolerably.
Even Goostree's is not absolutely extinct, but
has a chance of living thro' the dog days. I shall
be happy to hear from you, whether in the shape
of an official despatch or a familiar epistle. I
am very glad to see you write without the assistance
of a secretary. Perhaps, however, you will
not be able to read without the assistance of a
decypherer. At least in compassion to your eyesight
it is as well for me to try it no further.</p>

<p>
"So adieu. Yrs. ever sincerely,<br />
"<span class="smcap">W. Pitt</span>."<br />
</p>


<p>
"<span class="smcap">Brighthelmstone</span>,<br />
"<i>Wednesday, Aug. 6, 1783</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Wilberforce</span>,&mdash;<i>Anderson's Dictionary</i> I
have received, and am much obliged to you for it.
I will return it safe, I hope not dirtied, and possibly
not read. I am sorry that you give so bad an
account of your eyes, especially as this very letter
looks as if it would put them to a severe trial, and
might even defy the decypherer St. John, almost
without the help of an ænigma. I have only to
tell you that I have <i>no news</i>, which I consider as
making it pretty certain that there will be none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
now before the meeting of Parliament. The party
to Rheims hold of course, at least as far as depends
upon me; which is at least one good effect certain.
I wrote yesterday to Eliot,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> apprising him, that I
should be ready to meet him at Bankes's<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> before the
last day of August; that I conceived we must proceed
from thence to London, and that we ought to
start within the three or four first days of September.
I hope you will bear all these things in mind,
and recollect that you have to do with punctual
men, who would not risk their characters by being
an hour too late for any appointment. The lounge
here is excellent, principally owing to our keeping
very much to ourselves&mdash;that is Pulchritudo, Steele,
Pretyman, and myself. The Woodlys have been
here in high foining, and have talked me to death.
I would not bind myself to be a listener for life for
a good deal. Your friend the Commodore treated
us with his company at one or two assemblies, but
was called back to defend some prizes, which there
are those who contest with him, and which I fancy
he thinks <i>the greatest instance of malignity he ever
knew</i>. Mrs. Johnstone and Mrs. Walpole are left
to dispute the prize here. The first is clearly
the handsomer woman, but the husband of the
latter looks the quieter man, and the better part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
love as well as valor is discretion. I conclude as
you did, by desiring you to write immediately. I
go from hence to Somersetshire this day sennight,
and stay till Bankes's. Direct to Burton Pynsent,
Somerset, and <i>if you will</i>, by London.</p>

<p>
"Ever sincerely yrs.,<br />
"<span class="smcap">W. Pitt</span>."<br />
</p>


<p>Pitt's next letter refers to the General Election
of 1784, and William Wilberforce's candidature for
Yorkshire, which county he represented in Parliament
for twenty-eight years.</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Downing Street</span>,<br />
"<i>Tuesday, April 6, 1784</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Wilberforce</span>,&mdash;I have received your two
expresses, and one this morning from Mr. Wyvill.
I could not get to town till late last night, but sent
forward the letters you desired, and have done all I
can on the several subjects you mention.</p>

<p>"I have applied to our friends in town to pay in
the subscriptions, and I hope it will be done speedily.
I inquired at Cambridge with regard to the different
colleges. Trinity and St. John's have, I believe, as
might be expected, the most interest, and will both
exert it for you. Christ's has some, and I left that
in a good train. I have spoken to Lord Temple,
which is the only channel that has yet occurred to
me about Oxford, who thinks he can be of use
there. Wesley I have no doubt may be secured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
and I will lose no time in seeing him if necessary,
which I shall not think <i>at all awkward</i> at such a
time. Steps are taking to procure a meeting of
freeholders in your and Duncombe's interest, which
I hope will answer. I have sent to Robinson and
Hamilton. Lady Downe has been applied to, but can
be brought to nothing more than perfect neutrality.
Nesbitt's interest is secured, and he is thoroughly
zealous. I do not well know how to get at his
Grace of York, but will try every way I can. Lord
Percy, I am afraid, cannot be brought to subscribe,
tho' I do not quite despair of it. His objection
seems now from some delicacy towards Weddell,
with whom he has been much connected. He has,
however, written to exert all his interest in your
cause&mdash;particularly to Major Pallerne and Mr.
Rayne, whom Mr. Wyvill mentions in his last letter.
Lord Grantham, as I wrote you word before, must
go with Weddell. I expect to hear something more
of Lord Hawke, but I know he is now in the best
disposition. I shall keep my messenger an hour or
two to send the account of to-day's poll in Westminster,
yesterday and to-day having been considered
as the great push. Pray send me as quick
an account as possible, and continue it from time to
time, if a poll goes on. I hope you will be ready
with a candidate at Hull on the supposition of your
being seated for Yorkshire, which I am sanguine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
enough hardly to doubt. We are more successful
everywhere, with only a very few exceptions, than
can be imagined. I hope you bear all the fatigue
tolerably. I wish it was over. God bless you.</p>

<p>
"Most truly yours,<br />
"<span class="smcap">W. Pitt</span>.<br />
</p>


<p>"Compts. to Smith, and many thanks for his
letter. I hope he is still with you. The numbers
at Westminster to-day are&mdash;</p>

<p>
Hood.   Wray.   Fox.<br />
3936    3622    3413<br />
</p>

<p>Sawbridge has beat Atkinson only by seven, and
there is to be a scrutiny. The other members are
Watson, Lewes, and Newnham. Sir R. Clayton
declines for Surrey. Byng will probably be beat."</p>


<p>
"<span class="smcap">Downing Street</span>,<br />
"<i>Sunday, December 19, 1784</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Wilberforce</span>,&mdash;I have been so diligently
<i>turning my thoughts</i> on all sides since we
parted, that tho' they have been turned to you as
often as to any other quarter, I have never found
the moment to put them into writing till now. I
have not time to thank you sufficiently for the
picturesque and poetical epistle I received from
you dated, as I remember, from your boat, from
the inside and the imperial of your postchaise, and
two or three places more, and containing among
a variety of accurate descriptions one in particular,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
viewed from all those different situations, of the
sun setting in the middle of the day. I hope the
whole of your tour has continued to be embellished
by these happy incidents, and has kept you throughout
in as mad and rhapsodical a mood as at that
moment. I have some remorse in the immediate
occasion of my writing to you just now; which,
however, all things considered, I am bound to
overcome. Be it known to you, then, that as
much as I wish you to bask on, under an Italian
sun, I am perhaps likely to be the instrument of
snatching you from your present paradise, and
hurrying you back to 'the rank vapours of this
sin-worn mould.' A variety of circumstances concur
to make it necessary to give notice immediately
on the meeting of Parliament of the day on which
I shall move the question of the Reform. We
meet on the <i>25th of January</i>, and I think <i>about
three weeks after</i>, which will allow full time for a
call of the House, will be as late as I can easily
defer it. I would not for a thousand reasons have
you absent, tho' I hate that you should come before
your time, and if any particular circumstances
made a week or ten days a matter of real importance
to you, I think I could postpone it as long
as that.</p>

<p>"Only let me hear from you positively before the
meeting of Parliament. The chief thing necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
is that I should then be able to name <i>some</i> day, and
the precise day is of less consequence. You will
hardly believe me if I tell you that I entertain the
strongest hope of coming very near, if not absolutely
succeeding. I have seen the Oracle of Yorkshire,
Wyvill, and made him completely happy with the
prospect.</p>

<p>"All things are going, on the whole, exceeding
well. You will have learnt that the <i>Old Boy</i> at
last overcame his doubts, and has ventured single
into the Cabinet, which is a great point happily
settled. God bless you.</p>

<p>
"Ever most faithfully yours.<br />

</p>


<p>
"1784.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Wilberforce</span>,&mdash;I am sorry to find
from your letter from Nottingham that the Knight
of Yorkshire is in so much dudgeon. Tho', to say
the truth the instances of neglect you mention are
enough to provoke common patience. What is
worse, I know no remedy for it. My letter, which
missed you, contained no other information than that
the place of Marshall of the Admiralty had been
long since filled up. Some of the world is here at
present, and will be multiplying every day till the
meeting of Parliament. I expect Eliot in a very
few days. I know nothing of Bankes very lately.
Pray come to Wimbledon as soon as possible; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
want to talk with you about your navy bills,
which, tho' all your ideas now must go to landed
property, you should not entirely forget, and about
ten thousand other things. By the by, Lord Scarborough
is risen from the dead, as you probably
know. I have just received an account from Whitbread
that St. Andrew loses his election by three;
and would probably lose by more if he chooses a
scrutiny or a petition. Adieu.</p>

<p>
"Ever yrs.,<br />
"<span class="smcap">W. Pitt</span>.<br />
</p>


<p>"For the sake of this letter I am leaving a
thousand others unanswered, and a thousand projects
unread. You will probably think it was hardly
worth while."</p>

<p>The brotherly intimacy between Pitt and Wilberforce
is clearly shown in the next letter. Wilberforce
had written to Pitt to tell him of the change
in his religious opinions, and, in consequence, of
his probable retirement from political life. He no
doubt thought that Pitt would fail to sympathise
with his altered views, but the man who was "so
absorbed in politics that he had never given himself
time for due reflection on religion"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> wished to
understand the religious difficulties of his friend,
and with the greatest tenderness begs him to open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
his mind to "one who does not know how to
separate your happiness from his own."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Wilberforce</span>,&mdash;Bob Smith<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> mentioned
to me on Wednesday the letters he had
received from you, which prepared me for that I
received from you yesterday. I am indeed too
deeply interested in whatever concerns you not to
be very sensibly affected by what has the appearance
of a new æra in your life, and so important in
its consequences for yourself and your friends. As
to any public conduct which your opinions may
ever lead you to, I will not disguise to you that
few things could go nearer my heart than to find
myself differing from you essentially on any great
principle.</p>

<p>"I trust and believe that it is a circumstance
which can hardly occur. But if it ever should, and
even if I should experience as much pain in such an
event, as I have found hitherto encouragement and
pleasure in the reverse, believe me it is impossible
that it should shake the sentiments of affection and
friendship which I bear towards you, and which I
must be forgetful and insensible indeed if I ever
could part with. They are sentiments engraved
in my heart, and will never be effaced or weakened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
If I knew how to state all I feel, and could hope
that you are open to consider it, I should say a
great deal more on the subject of the resolution you
seem to have formed. You will not suspect me of
thinking lightly of any moral or religious motives
which guide you. As little will you believe that I
think your understanding or judgment easily misled.
But forgive me if I cannot help expressing my fear
that you are nevertheless deluding yourself into
principles which have but too much tendency to
counteract your own object, and to render your
virtues and your talents useless both to yourself
and mankind. I am not, however, without hopes
that my anxiety paints this too strongly. For
you confess that the character of religion is not a
gloomy one, and that it is not that of an enthusiast.
But why then this preparation of solitude, which
can hardly avoid tincturing the mind either with
melancholy or superstition? If a Christian may
act in the several relations of life, must he seclude
himself from them all to become so? Surely the
principles as well as the practice of Christianity
are simple, and lead not to meditation only but to
action. I will not, however, enlarge upon these
subjects now. What I would ask of you, as a mark
both of your friendship and of the candour which
belongs to your mind, is to open yourself fully and
without reserve to one, who, believe me, does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
know how to separate your happiness from his own.
You do not explain either the degree or the duration
of the retirement which you have prescribed
to yourself; you do not tell me how the future
course of your life is to be directed, when you think
the same privacy no longer necessary; nor, in short,
what idea you have formed of the duties which you
are from this time to practise. I am sure you will
not wonder if I am inquisitive on such a subject.
The only way in which you can satisfy me is by
conversation. There ought to be no awkwardness
or embarrassment to either of us, tho' there may
be some anxiety; and if you will open to me fairly
the whole state of your mind on these subjects, tho'
I shall venture to state to you fairly the points
where I fear we may differ, and to desire you to
re-examine your own ideas where I think you are
mistaken, I will not importune you with fruitless
discussion on any opinion which you have deliberately
formed. You will, I am sure, do justice to
the motives and feelings which induce me to urge
this so strongly to you. I think you will not refuse
it; if you do not, name any hour at which I can
call upon you to-morrow. I am going into Kent,
and can take Wimbledon in my way. Reflect, I
beg of you, that no principles are the worse for
being discussed, and believe me that at all events
the full knowledge of the nature and extent of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
opinions and intentions will be to me a lasting
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Pitt came the next morning according to his
proposal in this remarkable letter: when Wilberforce<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
"conversed with Pitt near two hours, and
opened myself completely to him.... He tried
to reason me out of my convictions, but soon
found himself unable to combat their correctness
if Christianity were true." To quote Lord Rosebery's
Preface<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> to these letters: "Surely a
memorable episode, this heart-searching of the
young saint and the young minister. They went
their different ways, each following their high ideal
in the way that seemed best to him. And so it
went on to the end, Wilberforce ever hoping to
renew the sacred conversation."</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Wilberforce</span>,&mdash;At length all the
obstacles of business, of idleness, and of procrastination
are so far overcome that I find myself with
my pen in my hand to answer your three letters.
I have seriously had it upon my conscience for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
some time; but yet I believe it is another influence
to which this present writing is to be immediately
ascribed. Having yesterday parted with the ornament
on my cheek, and two or three handkerchiefs
for the present occupying the place of it, my appearance
is better suited to correspondence than conversation;
and in addition to this I happen to have
an interval freer from business than at any time
since Parliament rose. Our French Treaty is
probably by this time actually signed, or will at
most not require more than one more messenger
to settle everything; but the winds have been so
unfavourable that I have been, for some days longer
than I expected, in suspense as to the issue of it.
Two or three more treaties are on the anvil, and
I think we shall meet with the appearance of not
having spent an idle or (as I flatter myself) a fruitless
summer. The multitude of things depending has
made the Penitentiary House long in deciding upon.
But I still think a beginning will be made in it before
the season for building is over; and if its progress
is as quick as that of my room at Hollwood, bolts
and bars will be useless before another season. I
am very glad you like our new Board of Trade,
which I have long felt to be one of the most
necessary, and will be now one of the most efficient
departments of Government. The colony for Botany
Bay will be much indebted to you for your assistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
in providing a chaplain. The enclosed will,
however, show you that its interests have not been
neglected, as well as that you have a nearer connection
with them than perhaps you were yourself
aware of. Seriously speaking, if you can find such
a clergyman as you mention we shall be very glad
of it; but it must be soon. My sister was brought
to bed of a daughter on Wednesday, and was at
first surprising well; but she has since had some
fever, which was to such a degree yesterday as to
make us very uneasy. She is now, however,
almost entirely free from it, and going on as well
as possible. I am in hopes of getting into Somersetshire
the middle of next week for about ten days.
Soon after I hope I may see you at Hollwood.
Bob Smith was in town lately, much better on the
whole, but not quite so well as I hoped to see
him. Adieu.</p>

"<i>Tuesday, April 8, 1788</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Wilberforce</span>,&mdash;I have just received
your letter of yesterday, and as I can easily imagine
how much the subject of it interests you, I will not
lose a moment in answering it. As to the Slave
Trade, I wish on every account it should come forward
in your hands rather than any other. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
that in the present year is impracticable; and I only
hope you will resolve to dismiss it as much as possible
from your mind. It is both the rightest and
wisest thing you can do. If it will contribute to
setting you at ease, that <i>I</i> should personally bring
it forward (supposing circumstances will admit of
its being brought forward this session) your wish
will decide. At all events, if it is in such a state
that it can be brought on, I will take care that it
shall be moved in a respectable way, and I will take
my part in it as actively as if I was myself the
mover. And if I was to consult entirely my own
inclination or opinion, I am not sure whether this
may not be best for the business itself; but on this,
as I have said already, your wish shall decide me.
With regard to the possibility of its being brought
on and finished this session, I can hardly yet judge.
The inquiry has been constantly going on, and we
have made a great progress. But it takes unavoidably
more time than I expected. In one word, however,
be assured that I will continue to give the business
constant attention, and do everything to forward it.
Whenever it is in such a state that you could yourself
have brought it on with advantage to the cause,
I will do it or undertake for its being done, in whatever
way seems most proper. I mean, therefore, to
accept it as a trust from you to the whole extent
you can wish, and to make myself responsible for it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
unless it is necessarily delayed till you are able to
resume it yourself.</p>

<p>"Any applications from your Society shall most
certainly be attended to. Justice Addington's
grievance in particular, which I was before acquainted
with by a memorial, will be immediately
removed. I do not like to write you a longer letter
than is absolutely necessary. I trust I need not
lengthen it to tell how impatiently I look to the
satisfaction of seeing you again, as stout and strong
as I hope you will return to us. Let me have from
time to time a line from any hand you can most
conveniently employ, to tell me how you go on,
and what are your motions during the summer. I
wish I may be able to arrange mine, when
holidays come, so as to fall in with you somewhere
or other. As soon as I can judge about Parliament
meeting before Christmas or not, you shall hear.
If it sits pretty late now, it probably will not meet
till after. Adieu for the present. Every good wish
attend you.</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Wilberforce</span>,&mdash;I have no small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
pleasure in writing to you quietly from hence, after
hearing the good account you sent me of yourself
confirmed by those who saw you then, and especially
by our friend Glynn. I am lucky enough
to have a wet evening, which, besides the good
I hope it will do to the country at large, has the
peculiar advantage of preventing me from paying
my personal respects to anyone of my constituents,
and so gives me the leisure to answer <i>seriatim</i> the
several sections of your letter. The business respecting
the Slave Trade meets just now with some
rub in the House of Lords, even in the temporary
regulation respecting the conveyance, which I
wonder how any human being can resist, and which
I therefore believe we shall carry; tho' it creates
some trouble, and will still protract the session a
week or ten days. We hear very little yet from
the West Indies, but a few weeks must bring more,
and I have no doubt the summer may be employed
in treating with foreign Powers to advantage. I
shall set about it with the utmost activity and with
good hopes of success, tho' founded as yet rather
on general grounds than any positive information.
There seems not a shadow of doubt as to the
conduct of the House of Commons next year, and
I think with good management the difficulties in
the other House may be got over. Your plan of a
mission to Bengal I mention only to show the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
punctuality of answering your letter, as you reserve
the discussion till we meet. As for Dr. Glass, I
was obliged to answer Thornton, who applied to me
for some such person (I think for this same Dr. Glass),
that the state of my engagements leaves me not at
liberty at present, and if you have any occasion to
say anything about it to them, be so good to speak
of it in the same style. Of the Penitentiary Houses
what can I say more? But in due time they shall
not be forgotten.</p>

<p>"My plan of visiting you and your lakes is, I
assure you, not at all laid aside. I cannot speak
quite certainly as to the time, but if there happens
nothing which I do not now foresee, it will be either
the beginning or middle of August; I rather think
the former, but I shall be able to judge better in
about a fortnight, and then you shall hear from me.
Nothing is decided about the meeting of Parliament,
but it is clear the trial will not go on till
February. I rather believe, however, that we
ought to meet and employ a month before Christmas;
as what with Slave Trade, Quebec Petition,
Poor Laws, Tobacco, &amp;c., we shall have more on
our hands than can be got through in any decent
time while we are exposed to the interruption from
Westminster Hall. I think I have now dispatched
all the points to which I was called upon to reply,
and come now to open my own budget; which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
must be done, however, in a <i>whisper</i>, and must not
as yet be repeated even to the most solitary echoes
of Windermere. You will wonder what mystery I
have to impart. At the first part you will not be
much surprised, which is that Lord Howe and his
friend Brett are to quit the Admiralty as soon as
the session closes. The cause (tho' its effects have
slept so long) is what passed last summer respecting
the promotion of Sir Charles Middleton. You will
not come to the surprising part when I add that
Lord Howe's successor must be a landman, as
there is no seaman who is altogether fit for the first
place at that board. But what will you say when I
tell you that the landman in question is no other
than my brother? He undertakes it very readily,
and will I am sure set about the business in earnest,
to which I believe you think him as equal as I do.
Lord Hood is to be at the board; not without
some risk of losing Westminster, but by keeping
our secret till the moment, I hope even that may be
saved; but it is comparatively of little consequence.
I feel the arrangement is liable to some invidious
objections, but I am satisfied they are more than
counterbalanced by the solid advantage of establishing
a complete concert with so essential a department,
and removing all appearance of a separate
interest. I shall be impatient, however, to hear
what you think of my scheme. There is nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
else that occurs worth adding to this long scrawl,
and I am obliged to seal it up, as in spite of the
rain which keeps me at home, I am in expectation
of an agreeable collection of dons whom Turner
has convened to smoke and sleep round his table
this evening. God bless you.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Wilberforce</span>,&mdash;I have certainly
given a considerable latitude to my promise of
writing in a fortnight, in defence of which I have
nothing to say, but that in addition to the common
causes of delaying a letter I could not easily resolve
to tell you that my northern scheme has for some
time grown desperate. Powers farther north and
the unsettled state of all the Continent (tho' not at
all likely to involve us in anything disagreeable)
require in our present system too much watching to
allow for a long absence. I have not yet got even
to Burton, which you will allow must be my first
object. But I assure you I am not the more in
love with Continental politics for having interfered
with a prospect I had set my heart so much upon,
as spending some quiet days on the bank of your
lake. Pray let me know in your turn what your
motions are likely to be, and when you think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
being in this part of the world. Parliament will
not meet till after Christmas. As to the Slave
Trade, we are digesting our Report as far as
present materials go, and you shall then have it;
but we are still in expectation of the answer from
the Islands. I had a long conversation with the
French Ambassador on the subject some time ago,
just before his going to France. He promised to
represent it properly, and seemed to think there
would be a favourable disposition. Their confusion
has been such since that scarce anything was likely
to be attended to; but I am in hopes Necker's
coming in will prove very favourable to this object.
The moment I hear anything respecting it I will
write again; and at all events in less than <i>my last
fortnight</i>. I must end now in haste to save the post

and I will move to fix it for this day fortnight if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
see no objection. I imagine the House must meet
on Friday on account of Hastings's business, but
that will probably be a reason for their adjourning
as soon as they come back from Westminster Hall,
and your business may, I dare say, wait till
Monday. In that case I would certainly meet you
at Hollwood on Friday, as I wish extremely to talk
over with you the whole business, and show you
our project, with which, like most projectors, we are
much delighted. From what you mention of the
parts you have been studying, I do not imagine
there is anything behind more material than what
you have seen, but I see no part of our case that is
not made out upon the strongest grounds. Steele

cannot be the least reason for your coming up

person to go directly to Paris. The message of
the Directory confessing in such strong terms their
distress (and the Archduke's recent victory on the

may be relied on), give some chance that our overtures
may be successful. In the meantime it will
be indispensable to take very strong measures
indeed, both of finance and military defence; and
if the spirit of the country is equal to the exigency,
I am confident all will yet end well. An immediate
Spanish war is, I think, nearly certain. The only
motive to it is the fear of France preponderating
over their fear of us; and the pretexts as futile as
could be wished. The alarm respecting the effect
on our trade is greatly overrated, as the whole
proportion of our exports thither compared with
the rest of the world is inconsiderable. You will see
that an Order of Council is published giving liberty
for the export of manufactures and the payment of
bills, which will, I hope, be satisfactory in your part
of the world. I delayed writing to Mr. Cookson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>

when it was taken, being in the hurry of a journey

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Wilberforce</span>,&mdash;I cannot refrain from
congratulating you most sincerely on the happy
event of the Signature of Preliminaries, which you
will, I believe, hear from Addington. The terms
are such as I am persuaded you will be well
satisfied with, and tho' they are not in every
point (particularly one material one) exactly all that
I should have wished, I have no hesitation in
saying that I think them on the whole highly
honourable to the country and very advantageous.
The event is most fortunate both for Government
and the public, and for the sake of both, gives me
infinite satisfaction. I am but just in time for the

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Wilberforce</span>,&mdash;I found your letter
on my arrival here yesterday, having escaped to
Hollwood on Friday only as a preparation for
pursuing my journey hither with less interruption
than I should have been exposed to, starting from
town. An absence of ten days or a fortnight has
been so much recommended, and indeed I began
myself to feel so much in want of it, that I am
afraid I must not think of returning for your motion.
Indeed, tho' I should most eagerly support it (supposing
you can provide, as I trust you can, means
of making the execution in the detail practicable
and effectual). I see no chance in the present state
of the session of your carrying it, unless Addington
can be brought really to see the propriety of it, and
to concur in it at once without debate. This last
I should hope might be managed, and whatever
impression parts of his speech may have made on
your mind, I am sure I need not suggest to you
that the best chance of doing this will be to endeavour
coolly to lay before him the case as it really
is, unmixed as far as possible with any topics of
soreness, which evidently were not absent from his
mind on Canning's motion. I certainly, on the whole,
judge much more favourably of his general intentions
on the whole subject (or, I should rather say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
of his probable conduct) than you do. But I admit
that one part of his speech was as unsatisfactory
as possible. This I really believe proceeded in a
great measure from the evident embarrassment and
distress under which he was speaking, and which I
am persuaded prevented him from doing any justice
to his own ideas. I may deceive and flatter myself,
but tho' I know we shall be far from obtaining
all that you and I wish, I really think there is much
chance of great real and substantial ground being
gained towards the ultimate and not remote object
of total abolition next session. This is far from a
reason for not endeavouring, if possible, to prevent
the aggravation of the evil in the meantime, and I
heartily wish you may be successful in the attempt.</p>

to recommend Bath before the winter, and

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Wilberforce</span>,&mdash;As you are among
the persons to whom the author of the enclosed
high-flown compliments refers for his character for
a very important purpose, I shall be much obliged
to you if you will tell me what you know of him.
A man's qualifications to give a dinner certainly
depend more on the excellence of his cook and his
wine, than on himself but I have still some curiosity
to know what sort of company he and his guests
are likely to prove; and should therefore be glad to
know a little more about them than I collect from
his list of the <i>dramatis personæ</i>, which for instruction
might as well have been taken from any old play-bill.
In the meantime I have been obliged out of common
civility, <i>provisoirement</i> to accept his invitation. I
was very sorry that I had too little time to spare in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
passing thro' town to try to see you. I should have
much wished to have talked over with you the events
which have been passing and the consequences to
which they seem to lead. You know how much
under all the circumstances I wished for peace, and
my wishes remain the same, if Bonaparte can be
made to feel that he is not to trample in succession
on every nation in Europe. But of this I fear there
is little chance, and without it I see no prospect
but war.</p>

<p>"I have not yet been here long enough to judge
much of the effect of these waters, but as far as I
can in a few days, I think I am likely to find them
of material use to me. I mean to be in town by the
18th of next month. Paley's work, which you mentioned
in your last letter, I had already read on the
recommendation of my friend Sir W. Farquhar,
who had met with it by accident, and was struck
with its containing the most compendious and
correct view of anatomy which he had ever seen.
I do not mean that he thought this its only merit.
It certainly has a great deal, but I think he carries
some of his details and refinements further than is
at all necessary for his purpose, and perhaps than
will quite stand the test of examination.</p>

your letter by that day's post, and I was interrupted
when I was going to write to you yesterday. It
was scarce possible for me, consistent with very
material business in this district, to have reached
town to-day; and besides, I confess, I do not think
any great good could have been done by anything
I could say in the House on any of the points you
mention. I feel most of them, however, and some
others of the same sort, as of most essential importance;
and I have thoughts of coming to town
for a couple of days (which is as much as I can
spare from my duties here) towards the end of the
week, to try whether I cannot find some channel by
which a remedy may be suggested on some of the
points which are now most defective. I think I
shall probably reach town on Saturday morning,
and I should wish much if you could contrive to
meet me in Palace Yard or anywhere else, to have
an hour's conversation with you. I will write to
you again as soon as I can precisely fix any day.

not commit myself to anything without looking to

and before I form any final decision, I shall much
wish to consult yourself and a few others whose
opinions I most value. If no new circumstance

<p><i>Mr. Wilberforce to Right Hon. William Pitt.</i></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Pitt</span>,&mdash;My head and heart have been
long full of some thoughts which I wished to
state to you when a little less under extreme pressure
than when Parliament is sitting. But my eyes
have been very poorly. I am now extremely hurried,
but I will mention two or three things as briefly as
possible that I may not waste your time. First,
perhaps even yet you may not have happened to
see an Order in Council allowing, notwithstanding
the War, an intercourse to subsist between our
West Indian Colonies and those of Spain, in which
negro slaves are the chief articles we are to supply.
I know these commercial matters are not within your
department, and that therefore your assent is asked,
if at all, when your mind is full of other subjects.
But let me only remind you, for it would be foolish
to write what will suggest itself to your own mind,
that the House of Commons did actually pass the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Bill for abolishing the foreign slave trade; and that
if contracts are made again for supplying Spain for
a term of years, it may throw obstacles in the way
of a foreign slave-trade abolition. It would give
me more pleasure than I can express to find any
further measures, or even thoughts, on this to me
painful subject, for many reasons, by hearing the
order was revoked. Second, I promised by compulsion
(I mean because I dislike to bore you) to
state to you on the part of the Deputy Receiver
General for the North and East Ridings of Yorkshire
and Hull that it would tend materially both to
facilitate and cheapen the collection of the new
assessed taxes to let them be collected at the same
time as the old ones. This will make the rounds
four times per annum instead of ten, and he says
the expense of collecting, if incurred six times per
annum, will amount to full one-half of all the present
salaries of the Receivers General in the Kingdom.
As he is a most respectable man, I ought to say
that he gives it as his opinion that the Receivers
General are not overpaid, all things considered.
But for my own opinion let me add that his principal
really has none of the labours of the office, and
the deputy even finds his securities for him. Third,
surely there ought at the Bank to be a distinction
between what is paid for assessed taxes and what as
free donation, when the subscription includes both:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
your own and those of many others are under that
head. Fourth, I suppose you are now thinking of
your taxes. Do, I beseech you, let one of them be a
tax on all public diversions of every kind, including
card-playing. I can't tell you how much their not
being taxed has been mentioned with censure, and
I promised to send you the enclosed letter from a
very respectable man. I am sorry I did, but now
have no option. But my first great object in writing
to you is most earnestly to press on your attention
a manuscript, which I have been desired to lay
before you, relative to Naval Discipline. You must
allow the writer to express himself with some perhaps
unpleasant idea of self-importance. But he
clearly foresaw the late Mutiny, and most strongly
urged the adoption of preventive measures, which,
had they been taken, I verily believe the greatest
misfortune this country ever suffered would not
have happened. That nothing was done is in my
mind&mdash;But I need not run on upon this to me
most painful topic, because it often suggests doubts
whether I have not been myself to blame, who
perused the scheme two years ago. Let me
earnestly entreat you, my dear Pitt, to peruse it
most seriously and impartially, and then let Dundas
read it. If you judge it proper, then either send it
Lord Spencer or to the writer, who is a good deal
nettled at his former communications to Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Spencer not being attended to. I will send the
manuscript by to-morrow's mail.</p>

Also the sixth chapter has almost a right to a

<p>"I have many thanks to offer you for your very
kind letter which I received this morning. Knowing,
as I do, how truly the sentiments of friendship
and affection you express, were returned on the
part of my poor brother towards you, I can only
assure you that it will afford me a most sensible
gratification that you should have, as an old, intimate

<p>Pitt was one of the few men whose lives have
affected the destiny of nations. The actions of
such men are so far-reaching, and the possibilities
of the might-have-been so great, that history hardly
ever passes a final verdict upon them. Wilberforce
had unexampled opportunities of gauging the character
and motives of Pitt, and certainly had no
strong partisan bias to warp his judgment. His
matured estimate of Pitt cannot fail therefore to be
of peculiar interest. It was written in 1821, sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
years after Pitt's death, and is printed exactly
as Wilberforce left it. It will no doubt recall to
the mind of the reader Scott's well-known lines:</p>

<p class="big center">SKETCH OF PITT BY W.

<p>Considering the effect of party spirit in producing
a distrust of all that is said in favour of a public
man by those who have supported him, and the
equal measure of incredulity as to all that is stated
of him by his opponents, it may not be without its
use for the character of Mr. Pitt to be delineated
by one who, though personally attached to him,
was by no means one of his partisans; who even
opposed him on some most important occasions,
but who, always preserving an intimacy with him,
had an opportunity of seeing him in all circumstances
and situations, and of judging as much as
any one could of his principles, dispositions, habits,
and manners.</p>

<p>It seems indeed no more than the payment of a
debt justly due to that great man that the friend
who occasionally differed from him should prevent
any mistake as to the grounds of those differences;
and that as he can do it consistently with truth, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
should aver, as in consistency with truth he can
aver, that in every instance (with perhaps one
exception only) in which his conscience prompted
him to dissent from Mr. Pitt's <i>measures</i>, he nevertheless
respected Mr. Pitt's <i>principles</i>; the differences
arose commonly from a different view of
facts, or a different estimate of contingencies and
probabilities. Where there was a difference of
political principles, it scarcely ever was such as
arose from moral considerations; still less such as
was produced by any distrust of Mr. Pitt's main
intention being to promote the well-being and
prosperity of his country.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt from his early childhood had but an
indifferent constitution; the gouty habit of body
which harassed him throughout his life, was manifested
by an actual fit of that disorder when he
was still a boy. As early as fourteen years of age
he was placed at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge; he
had even then excited sanguine expectations of
future eminence. His father had manifested a
peculiar regard for him; he had never, I believe,
been under any other than the paternal roof, where
his studies had been superintended by a private
tutor; and besides a considerable proficiency in
the Greek and Latin languages, he had written a
play in English, which was spoken of in high terms
by those who had perused it. I am sorry to hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
that this early fruit of genius is not anywhere to
be found.</p>

<p>While he was at the University his studies, I
understand, were carried on with steady diligence
both in classics and mathematics, and though as
a nobleman he could not establish his superiority
over the other young men of his time by his place
upon the tripos, I have been assured that his
proficiency in every branch of study was such as
would have placed him above almost all competitors.
He continued at the University till he
was near one-and-twenty, and it was during the
latter part of that period that I became acquainted
with him. I knew him, however, very little till
the winter of 1779-80, when he occupied chambers
in Lincoln's Inn, and I myself was a good deal in
London. During that winter we became more
acquainted with each other; we used often to meet
in the Gallery of the House of Commons, and
occasionally at Lady St. John's and at other
places, and it was impossible not to be sensible of
his extraordinary powers.</p>

<p>On the calling of a new Parliament in the beginning
of September, 1780, I was elected one of the
Members for Hull. Mr. Pitt, if I mistake not,
was an unsuccessful candidate for the University
of Cambridge; but about Christmas 1780-81,
through the intervention of some common friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
(more than one have claimed the honour of the
first suggestion, Governor Johnston, the Duke of
Rutland, &amp;c.), he received and accepted an offer
of a seat in Parliament made to him in the most
handsome terms by Sir James Lowther. From the
time of his taking his seat he became a constant
attendant, and a club was formed of a considerable
number of young men who had about the same
time left the University and most of them entered
into public life. The chief members were Mr.
Pitt, Lord Euston, now Duke of Grafton, Lord
Chatham, the Marquis of Graham, now Duke of
Montrose, the Hon. Mr. Pratt, now Marquis of
Camden, the Hon. St. Andrew St. John, Henry
Bankes, Esq., the Hon. Maurice Robinson, now
Lord Rokeby, Lord Duncannon, now Lord Besborough,
Lord Herbert, postea Earl of Pembroke,
Lord Althorp, now Lord Spencer, Robert Smith,
Esq., now Lord Carrington, Mr. Bridgeman, Mr.
Steele, several others, and myself. To these were
soon afterwards added Lord Apsley, Mr. Grenville,
now Lord Grenville, Pepper Arden, afterwards
Lord Alvanley, Charles Long, afterwards Lord
Farnborough, Sir William Molesworth, &amp;c. &amp;c.
Of the whole number Mr. Pitt was perhaps the
most constant attendant, and as we frequently
dined, and still more frequently supped together,
and as our Parliamentary attendance gave us so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
many occasions for mutual conference and discussion,
our acquaintance grew into great intimacy.
Mr. Bankes and I (Lord Westmoreland only
excepted, with whom, on account of his politics,
Mr. Pitt had little connection) were the only
members of the society who had houses of their
own, Mr. Bankes in London, and I at Wimbolton<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
in Surrey. Mr. Bankes often received his friends
to dinner at his own house, and they frequently
visited me in the country, but more in the following
Parliamentary session or two. In the spring of
one of these years Mr. Pitt, who was remarkably
fond of sleeping in the country, and would often
go out of town for that purpose as late as eleven
or twelve o'clock at night, slept at Wimbolton for
two or three months together. It was, I believe,
rather at a later period that he often used to sleep
also at Mr. Robert Smith's house at Hamstead.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Pitt was not long in the House of Commons
before he took a part in the debates: I was present
the first time he spoke, and I well recollect the
effect produced on the whole House; his friends
had expected much from him, but he surpassed all
their expectations, and Mr. Hatsell, the chief clerk
and a few of the older members who recollected
his father, declared that Mr. Pitt gave indications
of being his superior. I remember to this day the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
great pain I suffered from finding myself compelled
by my judgment to vote against him on the <i>second</i>
occasion of his coming forward, when the question
was whether some Commissioners of public
accounts should, or should not, be members of
Parliament: indeed I never can forget the mixed
emotions I experienced when my feelings had all
the warmth and freshness of early youth, between
my admiration of his powers, my sympathy with
his rising reputation, and hopes of his anticipated
greatness, while I nevertheless deemed it my duty
in this instance to deny him my support.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt was a decided and warm opponent of
Lord North's administration; so indeed were most
of our society, though I occasionally supported him.
From the first, however, I concurred with Mr. Pitt
in opposing the American War, and we rejoiced
together in putting an end to it in about March,
1782, when Lord North's ministry terminated; and
after a painful, and I think considerable, interval,
during which it was said the King had even talked
of going over to Hanover, and was supposed at last
to yield to the counsels of the Earl of Mansfield,
a new administration was formed consisting of the
Rockingham and Shelburne parties, the Marquis of
Rockingham being First Lord of the Treasury, and
Lord Shelburne and Mr. Fox the two Secretaries
of State. But though the parties had combined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
together against their common enemy, no sooner
had he been removed than mutual jealousies
immediately began to show themselves between
the Rockingham and Shelburne parties. I well
remember attending by invitation at Mr. Thomas
Townshend's, since Lord Sydney, with Mr. Pitt
and most of the young members who had voted
with the Opposition, when Mr. Fox with apparent
reluctance stated that Lord Rockingham had not
then been admitted into the King's presence, but
had only received communications through Lord
Shelburne; and little circumstances soon afterwards
arose which plainly indicated the mutual distrust of
the two parties. Lord Rockingham's constitution
was much shaken, and after a short illness his
death took place before the end of the session of
Parliament, about the middle of June, 1782.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Mr.
Pitt had taken occasion to declare in the House of
Commons that he would accept no subordinate
situation, otherwise there is no doubt he would have
been offered a seat at the Treasury Board, or
indeed any office out of the Cabinet; but on Lord
Rockingham's death, notwithstanding Mr. Fox's
endeavour to prevent a rupture by declaring that
<i>no disunion existed</i>,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> the disagreement between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
parties, of which so many symptoms had before
manifested themselves, became complete and
notorious. Lord Shelburne being invited by the
King to supply Lord Rockingham's place, Mr. Fox
with most of the Rockingham's party retired from
office, and Mr. Pitt accepted the offer made him by
Lord Shelburne of becoming Chancellor of the
Exchequer: he had completed his twenty-third year
the 28th of May preceding.</p>

<p>There was more than one day of debate even
during that session, in which Mr. Pitt indicated that
gravity and dignity which became the high station
which he had assumed at so early an age. He
continued in office till the ensuing winter, when,
after peace had been made both with America and
her continental allies France and Spain, Lord
Shelburne's administration was removed through
the unprincipled coalition between Lord North and
Mr. Fox and their respective parties. It was supposed
to have been brought about in a great degree
through the influence of Lord North's eldest son,
who had maintained a friendly acquaintance with
Mr. Fox, a man the fascination of whose manners
and temper was such as to render it impossible for
any one to maintain a personal intercourse with him
without conceiving for him sincere and even affectionate
attachment. I seconded the motion for the
address on the peace, and I well remember a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
before the business began writing a note in my
place with a pencil to Bankes, who was, I saw, at a
little distance, inquiring of him whether a union
between North and Fox was really formed, and
whether I might publicly notice it; "Yes," he
replied, "the more strongly the better." Mr. Pitt
on that night was very unwell; he was obliged to
retire from the House into Solomon's Porch by a
violent sickness at the very moment when Mr. Fox
was speaking. He himself afterwards replied in a
speech of some hours' length, but he certainly on
that night fell short of our expectations; a second
discussion, however, took place a few days after,
and his speech on that occasion was one of the
finest that was ever made in Parliament, both in
point of argument and power of oratory. I never
shall forget the impression produced by that part of
it in which he spoke of his own retirement, closing
with that passage out of Horace, "Laudo manentem,"
&amp;c., though I must add that I retain no
recollection whatever of the circumstance mentioned
by Sir N. Wraxall; indeed I cannot but be strongly
persuaded that he must have been misinformed.
Well also do I remember our all going to Mr. Pitt's
from the House of Commons after our defeat about
eight in the morning, where a dinner had been
waiting for us from eleven or twelve the preceding
night, and where we all laughed heartily at some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
characteristic traits exhibited by Lord Stanhope,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
then Lord Mahon. An administration was then
formed of which the Duke of Portland was at the
head, and Lord North and Mr. Fox joint Secretaries
of State. It was in the autumn of this year,
1783, during the recess of Parliament, that I
accompanied Mr. Pitt and Mr. Eliot, who afterwards
became his brother-in-law, to France: our
plan was to spend a few weeks in a provincial
town, there to acquire something of the language,
and afterwards to make a short stay at Paris.
Accordingly we went to Rheims, where we continued
for about six weeks. It was not until we
were on the point of going abroad (when Mr. Eliot
came out of Cornwall, Mr. Pitt from seeing his
mother in Somersetshire, and I met them both at
Sittingbourne) that we recollected that we were
unprovided with letters of recommendation, which
each of the party had perhaps trusted to the other
for obtaining. Accordingly we requested Mr.
Smith to obtain them for us of Mr. Thellusson,
afterwards Lord Rendlesham, who, we knew, had
correspondencies all over France. Thellusson
replied that he would gladly do his best for us, but
that he rather conceived from circumstances that his
correspondent at Rheims was not a person of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
commercial distinction. We, however, abided by
our decision in favour of Rheims. The day after
we arrived there, having sent our letter of recommendation
the preceding evening to the person to
whom it was addressed, we were waited upon by a
very well-behaved man with a velvet coat, a bag,
and sword, who conversed with us for a short time.
The next day we repaid his visit, and were a good
deal surprised to find that he was a very little
grocer, his very small shop being separated by a
partition from his very small room. But he was an
unaffected, well-behaved man, and he offered to
render us every service in his power, but stated
distinctly that he was not acquainted with the
higher people of the place and neighbourhood.
For a few days we lived very comfortably together,
but no French was learned except from the grammar,
we not having a single French acquaintance. At
length we desired our friend the <i>épicier</i> to mention
us to the Lieutenant of Police, who, I think we had
made out, had been employed to collect evidence in
the great Douglas cause, and was therefore likely
to know something of our country and its inhabitants.
This expedient answered its intended purpose,
though somewhat slowly and by degrees.
The Lieutenant of Police, Du Chatel, an intelligent
and apparently a respectable family man, came to
visit us, and he having stated to the Archbishop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Rheims, the present Cardinal de Perigord, whose
palace was about a mile from the city, that three
English Members of Parliament were then residing
in it, one of whom was Mr. Pitt, who had recently
been Chancellor of the Exchequer, his Grace sent
his Grand Vicaire, the Abbé de la Garde, to ascertain
the truth or falsehood of this statement. The
Abbé executed his commission with great address,
and reporting in our favour, we soon received an
invitation to the Archbishop's table, followed by the
expression of a wish that during the remainder of
our stay at Rheims we would take up our residence
in his palace. This we declined, but we occasionally
dined with him, and from the time of our
having been noticed by the Lieutenant we received
continual invitations, chiefly to supper, from the
gentry in and about the place. They were chiefly
persons whose land produced the wine of the
country, which, without scruple, they sold on their
own account. And I remember the widow of the
former Marshal Detrée intimating a wish that Mr.
Pitt would become her customer.</p>

<p>Thence we went to Paris, having an opportunity
during that time of spending four or five days
at Fontainebleau, where the whole Court was
assembled. There we were every evening at the
parties of one or other of the French Ministers, in
whose apartments we also dined&mdash;the Queen being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
always among the company present in the evening,
and mixing in conversation with the greatest
affability; there were also Madame la Princesse de
Lamballe, M. Segur, M. de Castres, &amp;c. Mr.
George Ellis, who spoke French admirably, was in
high favour for the elegance of his manners and the
ease and brilliancy of his wit; and Mr. Pitt, though
his imperfect knowledge of French prevented his
doing justice to his sentiments, was yet able to
give some impression of his superior powers&mdash;his
language, so far as it did extend, being remarkable,
I was assured, for its propriety and purity. There
M. le Marquis de la Fayette appeared with a somewhat
affected simplicity of manner, and I remember
the fine ladies on one occasion dragging him to the
card-table, while he shrugged up his shoulders and
apparently resisted their importunities that he would
join their party: very few, however, played at cards,
the Queen, I think, never. During our stay at
Paris we dined one day with M. le Marquis de la
Fayette with a very small party, one of whom was
Dr. Franklin; and it is due to M. le Marquis de la
Fayette to declare that the opinion which we all
formed of his principles and sentiments, so far as
such a slight acquaintance could enable us to form
a judgment, was certainly favourable, and his family
appeared to be conducted more in the style of an
English house than any other French family which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
we visited. We commonly supped in different
parties, and I recollect one night when we English
manifested our too common indisposition to conform
ourselves to foreign customs, or rather to put ourselves
out of our own way, by all going together to
one table, to the number of twelve or fourteen of
us, and admitting only one Frenchman, the Marquis
de Noailles, M. de la Fayette's brother-in-law, who
spoke our own language like an Englishman, and
appeared more than any of the other French to be
one of ourselves. We, however, who were all
young men, were more excusable than our Ambassador
at the Court of France, who, I remember,
joined our party.</p>

<p>It was at Paris, in October, that Mr. Pitt first
became acquainted with Mr. Rose, who was introduced
to him by Lord Thurlow, whose fellow-traveller
he was on the Continent; and it was then,
or immediately afterwards, that it was suggested to
the late Lord Camden by Mr. Walpole, a particular
friend of M. Necker's, that if Mr. Pitt should be
disposed to offer his hand to Mademoiselle N.,
afterwards Madame de Staël, such was the respect
entertained for him by M. and Madame Necker,
that he had no doubt the proposal would be
accepted.</p>

<p>We returned from France about November.
Circumstances then soon commenced which issued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
in the turning out of the Fox administration, the
King resenting grievously, as was said, the treatment
he experienced from them, especially in what
regarded the settlement of the Prince of Wales.
I need only allude to the long course of political
contention which took place in the winter of
1783-84, when at length Mr. Pitt became First
Lord of the Treasury; and after a violent struggle,
the King dissolved the Parliament about March,
and in the new House of Commons a decisive
majority attested the truth of Mr. Pitt's assertion
that he possessed the confidence of his country.
In many counties and cities the friends of Mr.
Fox were turned out, thence denominated Fox's
Martyrs.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> I myself became member for Yorkshire
in the place of Mr. Foljambe, Sir George Savile's
nephew, who had succeeded that excellent public
man in the representation of the county not many
weeks before. I may be allowed to take this
occasion of mentioning a circumstance honourable
to myself, since it is much more honourable to him,
that some years after he came to York on purpose
to support me in my contest for the county. It is
remarkable that Lord Stanhope first foresaw the
necessity there would be for Mr. Pitt's continuing
in office notwithstanding his being out-voted in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
House of Commons, maintaining that the Opposition
would not venture to refuse the supplies, and
that at the proper moment he should dissolve the
Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>And now having traced Mr. Pitt's course from
childhood to the period when he commenced his
administration of sixteen or seventeen years during
times the most stormy and dangerous almost ever
experienced by this country, it may be no improper
occasion for describing his character, and specifying
the leading talents, dispositions, and qualifications by
which he was distinguished. But before I proceed
to this delineation it may be right to mention that
seldom has any man had a better opportunity of
knowing another than I have possessed of being
thoroughly acquainted with Mr. Pitt. For weeks
and months together I have spent hours with him
every morning while he was transacting his common
business with his secretaries. Hundreds of times,
probably, I have called him out of bed, and have,
in short, seen him in every situation and in his
most unreserved moments. As he knew I should
not ask anything of him, and as he reposed so much
confidence in me as to be persuaded that I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
never use any information I might obtain from him
for any unfair purpose, he talked freely before me of
men and things, of actual, meditated, or questionable
appointments and plans, projects, speculations,
&amp;c., &amp;c. No man, it has been said, is a hero to his
<i>valet de chambre</i>, and if, with all the opportunities I
enjoyed of seeing Mr. Pitt in his most inartificial
and unguarded moments, he nevertheless appeared
to me to be a man of extraordinary intellectual and
moral powers, it is due to him that it should be
known that this opinion was formed by one in whose
instance Mr. Pitt's character was subjected to its
most severe test, which Rochefoucault appeared to
think could be stood by no human hero.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt's intellectual powers were of the highest
order, and in private no less than in public, when he
was explaining his sentiments in any complicated
question and stating the arguments on both sides, it
was impossible not to admire the clearness of his
conceptions, the precision with which he contemplated
every particular object, and a variety of
objects, without confusion. They who have had
occasion to discuss political questions with him in
private will acknowledge that there never was a
fairer reasoner, never anyone more promptly recognising,
and allowing its full weight to every consideration
and argument which was urged against the
opinion he had embraced. You always saw <i>where</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
you differed from him and <i>why</i>. The difference
arose commonly from his sanguine temper leading
him to give credit to information which others might
distrust, and to expect that doubtful contingencies
would have a more favourable issue than others
might venture to anticipate. I never met with any
man who combined in an equal degree this extraordinary
precision of understanding with the same
intuitive apprehension of every shade of opinion, or
of feeling, which might be indicated by those with
whom he was conversant. In taking an estimate of
Mr. Pitt's intellectual powers, his extraordinary
memory ought to be specially noticed. It was
indeed remarkable for two excellencies which are
seldom found united in the same person&mdash;a facility of
receiving impressions, and a firmness and precision
in retaining them. His great rival, Mr. Fox, was
also endowed with a memory which to myself used
to appear perfectly wonderful. Often in the earlier
part of my Parliamentary life I have heard him
(Fox) at a very late hour speak, without having
taken any notes, for two or three hours, noticing
every material argument that had been urged by
every speaker of the opposite party: this he commonly
did in the order in which those arguments
had been delivered, whereas it was rather Mr. Pitt's
habit to form the plan of a speech in his mind while
the debate was going forward, and to distribute his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
comments on the various statements and remarks of
his opponents according to the arrangement which
he had made. Such was his (Pitt's) recollection of
the great classical authors of antiquity that scarcely
a passage could be quoted of their works, whether
in verse or prose, with which he was not so familiar
as to be able to take up the clue and go on with
what immediately followed. This was particularly
the case in the works of Virgil, Horace, and Cicero,
and I am assured that he was also scarcely less
familiar with Homer and Thucydides.</p>

<p>He had considerable powers of imagination and
much ready wit, but this quality appeared more to
arise from every idea, and every expression that
belonged to it, being at once present to his mind, so
as to enable him at will to make such combinations
as suited the purpose of the moment, than as if his
mind was only conscious at the time of that particular
coruscation which the collision of objects caused to
flash before the mental eye. It arose out of this
distinctive peculiarity that he was not carried away
by his own wit, though he could at any time command
its exercise, and no man, perhaps, at proper
seasons ever indulged more freely or happily in that
playful facetiousness which gratifies all without
wounding any. He had great natural courage and
fortitude, and though always of a disordered stomach
and gouty tendencies (on account of which port wine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
had been recommended to him in his earliest youth,
and drinking French wine for a day or two would at
any time produce gouty pains in the extremities),
yet his bodily temperament never produced the
smallest appearance of mental weakness or sinking.
I think it was from this source, combined with that
of his naturally sanguine temper, that though manifestly
showing how deeply he felt on public affairs,
he never was harassed or distressed by them, and till
his last illness, when his bodily powers were almost
utterly exhausted, his inward emotions never appeared
to cloud his spirits, or affect his temper.
Always he was ready in the little intervals of a busy
man to indulge in those sallies of wit and good
humour which were naturally called forth.</p>

<p>Excepting only the cases of those who have had
reason to apprehend the loss of life or liberty, never
was a public man in circumstances more harassing
than those of Mr. Pitt in 1784: for several weeks
the fate of his administration and that of his opponents
were trembling on the beam, sometimes one
scale preponderating, sometimes the other; almost
daily it appeared doubtful whether he was to continue
Prime Minister or retire into private life. Yet
though then not five-and-twenty I do not believe
that the anxiety of his situation ever kept him
awake for a single minute, or ever appeared to
sadden or cast a gloom over his hours of relaxation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>It cannot perhaps be affirmed that he was altogether
free from pride, but great natural shyness,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
and even awkwardness (French <i>gaucherie</i>), often
produced effects for which pride was falsely charged
on him; and really that confidence which might be
justly placed in his own powers by a man who could
not but be conscious of their superiority might
sometimes appear like pride, though not fairly deserving
that appellation; and this should be the rather
conceded, because from most of the acknowledged
effects of pride upon the character he was eminently
free. No man, as I have already remarked, ever
listened more attentively to what was stated against
his own opinions; no man appeared to feel more for
others when in distress; no man was ever more kind
and indulgent to his inferiors and dependents of
every class, and never were there any of those little
acts of superciliousness, or indifference to the feelings
and comforts of others, by which secret pride
is sometimes betrayed. But if Mr. Pitt was not
wholly free from pride, it may truly be affirmed that
no man was perhaps ever more devoid of vanity in
all its forms. One particular more in Mr. Pitt's
character, scarcely ever found in a proud man, was
the extraordinary good humour and candour with
which he explained and discussed any plan or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
measure, of which he had formed the outline in his
mind, with those professional men who were necessarily
to be employed in giving it a Parliamentary
form and language. I do not believe that there is a
single professional man or the head of any board
who ever did business with him, who would not
acknowledge that he was on such occasions the most
easy and accommodable man with whom they ever
carried on official intercourse. One instance of this
kind shall be mentioned as a specimen of the others.
He had formed a plan of importance (I think in
some Revenue matter) on which it was necessary
for him to consult with the Attorney-General of the
day, I believe Chief Baron Macdonald; Mr. Pitt
had been for some time ruminating on the measure,
his mind had been occupied for perhaps a month in
moulding it into form and in devising expedients for
its more complete execution. It may here be not
out of place to mention as a peculiarity of his character
that he was habitually apt to have almost his
whole thoughts and attention and time occupied with
the particular object or plan which he was then
devising and wishing to introduce into practice. He
was as usual full of his scheme, and detailed it to
his professional friend with the warmth and ability
natural to him on such occasions. But the Attorney-General
soon became convinced that there were
legal objections to the measure, which must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
decisive against its adoption. These therefore he
explained to Mr. Pitt, who immediately gave up his
plan with the most unruffled good-humour, without
attempting to hang by it, or to devise methods of
propping it up, but, casting it at once aside, he pursued
his other business as cheerfully and pleasantly
as usual.</p>

<p>But there are many who with undisturbed composure
and with a good grace can on <i>important</i>
occasions thus change their line of conduct and
assume a course contrary to that which they would
have preferred. It is, however, far more rare to
find men who on little occasions, which are not of
sufficient moment to call a man's dignity into action,
and which are not under the public eye, can bear to
have their opinions opposed and their plans set
aside, without manifesting some irritation or momentary
fretfulness. But on the lesser scale as well as on
the greater Mr. Pitt's good-humour was preserved.
This same disposition of mind was attended with
the most important advantages, and in truth was one
which eminently qualified him to be the Minister of
a free country.</p>

<p>If towards the latter end of his life his temper
was not so entirely free from those occasional approaches
to fretfulness which continued disease and
the necessity of struggling against it too often produce,
it ought to be taken into account that another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
powerful cause besides human infirmity might have
tended to lessen that kindness and good-humour for
which he was for the greater part of his life so remarkable.
The deference that was paid to him was
justly great, but though no man less than himself
exacted anything like servility from his companions,
it is impossible to deny that there were those who
attempted to cultivate his favour by this species of
adulation. Another particular in Mr. Pitt, seldom
connected with pride, was the kind interest he took
in the rising talents of every young public man of
any promise whose politics were congenial with his
own; as well as the justice which he did to the
powers of his opponents&mdash;a quality which it is but
fair to say was no less apparent in Mr. Fox also.
If he sometimes appeared to be desirous of letting a
debate come to a close without hearing some friends
who wished to take a part in it, this arose in some
degree in his wishing to get away, from his being
tired out with Parliamentary speaking and hearing,
or from thinking that the debate would close more
advantageously at the point at which he stopped.</p>

<p>In society he was remarkably cheerful and
pleasant, full of wit and playfulness, neither, like
Mr. Fox, fond of arguing a question, nor yet
holding forth, like some others.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> He was always
ready to hear others as well as to talk himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
In very early life he now and then engaged in
games of chance, and the vehemence with which
he was animated was certainly very great; but finding
that he was too much interested by them, all at
once he entirely and for life desisted from gambling.</p>

<p>His regard for truth was greater than I ever
saw in any man who was not strongly under the
influence of a powerful principle of religion: he
appeared to adhere to it out of respect to himself,
from a certain moral purity which appeared to be
a part of his nature. A little incident may afford
an example of his delicacy in this respect. A
common friend of ours, a member of the House
of Lords, was reflected upon with considerable
acrimony in the House of Commons by one of
Mr. Pitt's political opponents. Being with him, as
often happened, the next morning, while he was
at breakfast, I told him that the animadversions
which had been made on our friend the night
before were stated in the newspaper, and I expressed
some surprise that he himself had not
contradicted the fact which was the ground of the
reprehension. "This," said he, "I might have
done, but you will remember that it was a
circumstance in which, if I deviated from strict
truth, no other man could know of it, and in such
a case it is peculiarly requisite to keep within the
strictest limits of veracity."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>The remark I am about to make may deserve
the more attention on account of its general application,
and because it may probably tend to illustrate
other characters. It may, I believe, be truly affirmed
that the imputations which were sometimes thrown
out against Mr. Pitt, that he was wanting in simplicity
and frankness, and the answers he made to
questions put to him concerning his future conduct,
or the principles which were regulating the course
of measures he pursued, were in truth a direct
consequence of that very strictness and veracity
for which he was so remarkable. When men are
not very scrupulous as to truth, they naturally deal
in broad assertions, especially in cases in which their
feelings are at all warmly engaged; but it seldom
happens that a political man can thus assume a
principle and apply it to all the cases, which, in
the use he is about to make of it, it may be
supposed to comprehend, without some qualifications
and distinctions; and a man of strict
veracity therefore makes a conditional declaration
or gives a qualified assurance. The same remark
applies to the judgments we may express of the
character and conduct of public men. In order to
be strictly correct we cannot always use broad and
strong colouring, but there must be shades and
gradations in our draught. Yet such is the natural
and even commendable love which men generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
have of truth and honesty, that we feel an instinctive
preference of simple and strong affirmations or negations
as indicating more blunt and straightforward
principles and dispositions, than where men express
themselves in measured and qualified and conditional
propositions. No man, I believe, ever loved his
country with a warmer or more sincere affection;
it was highly gratifying to converse familiarly with
him on the plans he was forming for the public good;
or to witness the pleasure he experienced from
indulging speculations of the benefits which his
country might derive from the realising of such or
such a hope.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding all my admiration of Mr.
Pitt's extraordinary powers, and still more, with
the deepest and most assured conviction of his
public spirit and patriotism, I cannot but think that
even his uncommon excellencies were not without
some alloy of human infirmity. In particular he
appeared to me to be defective in his knowledge
of human nature, or that from some cause or other
he was less sagacious than might have been expected
from his superior talents, in his estimate of future
events, and sometimes in his judgment of character.
This might probably arise in part from his naturally
sanguine temper, which in estimating future contingencies
might lead him to assign too little weight to
those probabilities which were opposed to his ultimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
conclusion. But if I must be honest in delineating
Mr. Pitt's character and qualities, I must also confess
that in considering their practical influence on the
fortunes of his country, I have sometimes been
almost ready to believe that powers far inferior to his,
under the direction of a mind equally sincere and
equally warm in its zeal for the public good, might
have been the instrument of conferring far greater
benefits on his country. His great qualities, under
the impulse and guidance of true religion, would
probably have been the means of obtaining for his
country much greater temporal blessings, together
with others of a far higher order, and more durable
effects. The circumstances of the period at which
he first came into the situation of Prime Minister
were such as almost to invest him with absolute
power. All his faculties then possessed the bloom
of youthful beauty as well as the full vigour of
maturer age: his mind was ardent, his principles
were pure, his patriotism warm, his mind as yet
altogether unsullied by habitually associating with
men of worldly ways of thinking and acting, in
short, with a class which may be not unfitly termed
trading politicians; this is a class with which perhaps
no one, however originally pure, can habitually
associate, especially in the hours of friendly intercourse
and of social recreation, without contracting
insensibly more or less defilement. No one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
had not been an eye-witness could conceive the
ascendency which Mr. Pitt then possessed over
the House of Commons, and if he had then generously
adopted the resolution to govern his country
by <i>principle</i> rather than by <i>influence</i>, it was a
resolution which he could then have carried into
execution with success, and the full effects of which,
both on the national character, interests, and happiness,
it is scarcely possible perhaps to estimate; but
it would be a curious and no unprofitable speculation
to trace the probable effects which would have
resulted from the assumption of this high moral
tone, in the actual circumstances of this country, in
reference both to our internal interests and our foreign
relations. This is a task I cannot now undertake,
but I may remind the reader that the principles were
then beginning to propagate themselves with the
greatest success which not long after exhibited their
true nature and ruinous effects in the French Revolution.
Such a spirit of patriotism would have
been kindled, such a generous confidence in the
King's government would have been diffused
throughout all classes, that the very idea of the
danger of our being infected with the principles of
French licentiousness, which might have produced
among our people a general taint of disloyalty,
would have been an apprehension not to be
admitted into the bosom of the most timid politician;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
while the various reforms which would have
taken place, and the manifest independence of
Parliament would have generated and ensured in
the minds of all reasonable men a continually increasing
gratitude and affection for the constitution
and laws of our country. On the other hand, the
French, infatuated as they were, and wicked as were
the men who then possessed the chief influence in
the counsels of that country, could never have been
so blind to their own manifest interest, as to have
engaged their people in a war with Great Britain
from any idea of our confederating with the
Crowned Heads of Europe to crush the rising
spirit of liberty in France. Hence we should
have escaped that long and bloody war, which,
however, in its ultimate issue justly deserving the
epithet of glorious, is nevertheless the cause of
all our present dangers and sufferings, from the
insupportable burdens with which it has loaded us.
Nor is it only <i>Financial</i> evils of which our long
protracted warfare has been the cause; to this
source also we must probably trace much of that
<i>Moral</i> evil, which in so many different forms has
been of late beginning to manifest itself, especially
among the lower orders of our people. The
gracious Providence of God has indeed abundantly
answered the prayers of many among us, who I
trust have all along been looking up to the Giver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of all Good for their country's safety and prosperity;
and while those causes were in operation
which were hereafter to manifest themselves in
various forms of social and domestic evil, it
pleased God to diffuse a spirit of an opposite
kind, which began to display its love of God and
love of man by the formation of societies of a
religious and moral nature, which have already
contributed in no small degree to bless almost
all nations, while they have invested our own
country with a moral glory never before enjoyed
by any nation upon earth. The diffusion of the
Sacred Scriptures, the establishment of societies
for spreading throughout the world the blessings
of religious light and of moral improvement, the
growing attention to the education of our people,
with societies and institutions for relieving every
species of suffering which vice and misery can
ever produce among the human race,&mdash;what
would have been the effects of all this, if not
obstructed and counteracted in all the various
ways by which war, that greatest scourge of the
human race, carries on its baleful and wide
wasting operations.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Is it not a melancholy consideration that this
very country, the constitution and laws of which
have been the objects of the highest possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
admiration of the wisest men, should be in such a
state that but too large a part of the great body of
our people, instead of looking up to Heaven with
gratitude for being favoured with blessings never
before enjoyed by any nation, should be led by
their sufferings to regard that very constitution and
those very laws with disgust and aversion? Of
this unhappy state of things the war, as having
been the cause of our financial distresses and
difficulties, is in fact the source. But there is
nothing in which we are so apt to deceive ourselves
as in conceiving that we are capable of estimating
the full amount of moral good or evil; short-sighted
as we are, there is nothing in which our views are
more manifestly narrow and contracted; an important,
nay, an awful consideration, which, while it
may well encourage to activity in all good, should
make us tremble to admit (the slightest speck) the
smallest seed of moral evil to pollute our country's
soil. But I have been led to expatiate more than
I intended on this topic, though merely glancing at
some of the most important of the considerations
which it presents to the view even of the most
superficial observer.</p>

<p>Returning to the consideration of the effect of
true religion on the character and conduct of the
great man who has been the subject of this inquiry,
I am naturally led to remark that there can be no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
possible occasion on which the application of the
principle on which I have been lately speaking
would suggest wider scope for our reflection. But
if we consider the effect which true religion would
have produced either in himself or in others around
him, how immense would appear the mass of benefits,
in the employment of his time, in the application
of his faculties, in the selection of his companions,
perhaps, above all, in his giving their just
weight to religious and moral principles and character
in the exercise of his unlimited patronage,
both in Church and State; and considering that
every religious and good man, who by him should
have been invested with power and influence, would
<i>himself</i> have selected others of similar principles
and character, throughout the descending series of
official appointments, and through all the variety of
social occupations, who can say what would have
been the effect of these religious and moral secretions,
if they may be so termed, which throughout
the whole political body would have been gradually
producing their blessed effects in augmenting its
fulness, symmetry, and strength?<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> And these
effects, remember, would have been of a merely
public, still less of a merely political character.
They would have been, to say the least, full as
manifest, and even more fertile in the production<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
of happiness in all the walks of private life and all
the varieties of social combination.</p>

<p>In considering the estimates which were formed
of Mr. Pitt's and Mr. Fox's characters respectively,
more especially in point of what may be called
popularity; and also as to their reputation for
genius, wit, and classical taste, it should be
remembered that Mr. Fox happened to have
become connected, both at school and at Oxford,
with a circle of men eminent for talents and
classical proficiency, men also who were not shut
up in cloisters, but who lived in the world, and gave
the tone in the highest and most polished societies
of the metropolis. Among these were Mr. Hare,
General Fitzpatrick, Lord John Townshend; and
to these must be added Mr. Windham, Mr. Erskine,
and, above all, Mr. Sheridan. Mr. Pitt had also
several college friends who came into Parliament
about the same period with himself, men of no
inferior consideration­&mdash;Mr. Bankes, Mr. Eliot, Lord
Abercorn, Lord Spencer, and several others. But
these, it must be confessed, were by no means men
of the same degree of brilliancy as the former set;
nor did they in the same degree live in the circle of
fashion and there diffuse their own opinions. Again
Mr. Fox's political connections were numerous, and
such as naturally tended to stamp a high value on
his character. Burke, Barré­&mdash;for there were those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
also who though not of Fox's party, often associated
with him in private, and tended to sustain the
general estimate of his superiority; of these were
Gibbon, Lord Thurlow, Dunning, Jeykell.</p>

</div>

<p>Again, the necessity under which Mr. Pitt often
lay of opening and speaking upon subjects of a low
and vulgarising quality, such as the excise on
tobacco, wine, &amp;c., &amp;c., topics almost incapable
with propriety, of an association with wit or grace,
especially in one who was so utterly devoid of all
disposition to seek occasions for shining, tended to
produce a real mediocrity of sentiment and a lack
of ornament, as well as to increase the impression
that such was the nature of his oratory. Also the
speeches of a minister were of necessity more
guarded, and his subjects, except where he was
opening some new proposition or plan, were rather
prescribed to him by others, than selected by himself.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The MS. of Canning's lines on Pitt is amongst
the Wilberforce Papers; they are so little known
that no apology is needed for inserting them here.
Canning wrote them for the feast in honour of Pitt's
birthday, May 28, 1802. It will be remembered
that Pitt had resigned in 1801, because the King
would not accept his Irish policy. A vote of censure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
had been moved, and was not merely rejected,
but, by an overwhelming majority, it was carried
"that the Right Hon. William Pitt has rendered
great and important services to his country, and
especially deserved the gratitude of this House."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><i>Right Hon. George Rose to Mr. Wilberforce.</i></p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Old Palace Yard</span>,<br />
<br />
"<i>November 4, 1790</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Wilberforce</span>,&mdash;I was shocked this
morning in putting my papers in order on my table
to find a letter I wrote to you before I went into
the country; you must have thought me shamefully
inattentive to you, which I trust I never shall be
while I retain my senses, for anxious as I am to
avoid such an imputation in general I do assure
you I am particularly so to stand clear of that in
your opinion. I will now, however, make you
ample amends for the seeming neglect by telling
you that the expected messenger is arrived and
brings us an account of peace <i>certain</i> and <i>unequivocal</i>,
on the very terms (I may say to you)
<i>prescribed</i> from hence; they secure to us great
and essential points important to the interests
of the country, and must prevent future occasions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
of quarrel with Spain; war with all its certain
and possible consequences are (<i>sic</i>) avoided. So
much for public benefits; what it must produce
to the individual<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> to whom the merit is justly
and fairly to be ascribed it is impossible at once
to foresee&mdash;I mean with respect to character
of everything that can be valuable to a man in
his situation.</p>

<p>"I have actually been drunk ever since ten
o'clock this morning, and have not yet quite the
use of my reason, but I am</p>

<p>
"Yours most faithfully and cordially,<br />
<br />
"<span class="smcap">George Rose.</span>"<br />
</p>


<p>Pitt's views as to a bounty on corn in the
scarcity then<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> prevailing are given by Rose in the
next letter.</p>

<p><i>Right Hon. G. Rose to Mr. Wilberforce.</i></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Wilberforce</span>,&mdash;It would be very
odd if your writing to me on the subject of your
last, or indeed on any other, could require an
apology; I regret only that I cannot give you
the light upon it you wish.</p>

<p>"With respect to measures within the reach
of Government to relieve the scarcity I fear none
can be effectual. Mr. Pitt cannot, as you know,
after his declaration in Parliament, import at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
expense or risk of the public, but he is inclined
to give a bounty on corn imported when it shall
be <i>below</i> a certain price within a limited time.
This is a new principle, but I really believe it
would produce much good. The idea occurred to
him on reading Mr. Richardson's letter to you,
who stated the great discouragement of individuals
importing to be the risk of prices being low on the
arrival of cargoes in the spring; I was so much
struck with Mr. Richardson's observations that I
wrote to beg him to call on me last Monday, but
he had unfortunately set off that morning for
Liverpool. I am more than half disposed to take
the chance of prevailing with him to come up
again.</p>

<p>"During our late sitting the Scotch distilleries
were stopped, but the prices of barley in England
were not <i>then</i> such as to induce any man to hint
even at the English; and of course there is now
no power to prevent them going on. We did
prohibit the distillation of wheat; and allowed the
importation of starch at the Home Duty, which
will stop that manufactory; but I deplore most
sincerely and earnestly any agreement against the
use of hair powder, not merely for the sake
of a large revenue, but to avoid other mischief
which I am very sure is not enough attended to,
the distinction of dress and external appearance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
The inattention to that has been a great support
of Jacobinism.</p>

<p>"The resolutions which were taken in the last
scarcity for restraining the use of flour, &amp;c., were
so little attended, and were on the whole productive
of so little good that Mr. Pitt has not thought it yet
advisable to recur to them. I believe <i>much</i> may be
done, especially in towns, by soup shops, respecting
which I should think Mr. Bernard can inform you
as fully as any one, from the share he took in the
conduct of them in London last winter. Perhaps
the article may be made somewhat cheaper here
than anywhere else from there being a larger
quantity of coarse parts of the meat than in any
country place, but the soup was made admirably
good, palatable and nutritive for twopence a quart,
and retailed at half that price; one pint an ample
allowance for each person, taking adults and
children together, so that for one halfpenny a day
a comfortable mess was provided for a poor person.
I am making the experiment both at Christ Church
and Lyndhurst and I shall soon see how it will
answer. I am not sure but that some general plan
of that sort will be as likely as any other to be
useful now. I think also of importing a cargo
of corn now, as I did pork on the last occasion, and it
may be a good thing to encourage others to do the
same for the supply of their respective neighbourhoods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
which people will be more disposed to do if Mr.
Pitt should propose the bounty I have alluded to.</p>

<p>"The dry weather during the last twelve days
I hope will be productive of infinite good; nothing
could be more fortunate, as the seed I hope will
now be all well got in, which may have an immediate
effect in lowering the prices."</p>

<p>A letter of a later date from Rose follows as to
the payment of Pitt's debts by subscription amongst
his friends. Wilberforce was sanguine as to the
success of this plan "considering the number of
affluent men connected with Pitt, some of whom
have got great and lucrative places from him."
Wilberforce drew up a list of sixty-three persons
who "might be expected to contribute." But the
plan of a private subscription fell to the ground.</p>


<p><i>Right Hon. G. Rose to Mr. Wilberforce.</i></p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Old Palace Yard</span>,<br />
<br />
"<i>January 25, 1806, Saturday</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Wilberforce</span>,&mdash;I told you, immediately
after the receipt of your former letters, that
all thought of applying to Parliament for payment
of Mr. Pitt's debts was abandoned; and measures
are taking for the attainment of that object, which
will be very greatly assisted by your endeavours
I am sure. Mr. Samuel Thornton and Mr.
Angerstein are to meet several gentlemen in the
city on Tuesday morning to promote a private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
subscription, and whatever may be necessary to
be done at this end of the town I trust will be
effected. I hope I expressed myself intelligibly
respecting your motives&mdash;you cannot be more
certain of them than I am&mdash;and I felt deeply
obliged by the plainness with which you expressed
your sentiments; they decided my conduct instantly,
as I told you before.</p>

<p>"As to the wish expressed by our late inestimable
friend relative to the Stanhopes, I suggested to you
that as provision had been made for the husbands
of the two elder ones, equal to £1,000 a year,
I believe, for each, I thought a further one by
Parliament could hardly be acquiesced in. For
Lady Hester I hoped no difficulty would be made
in providing an annuity to that amount. The two
young men are in the army&mdash;<i>they</i> are not of Mr.
Pitt's blood and small sinecure employments are
given to them which will aid their income.</p>

<p>"Three gentlemen are to meet in the city on
Monday to concert the best measures for promoting
the subscription, and you shall know the result.
You will, I am persuaded, come in to attend the
House on that day.</p>

Lord Melville,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> "the only minister to whose judgment
Pitt greatly deferred." Wilberforce writes
of him as "an excellent man of business and a
fine, warm-hearted fellow," but later on he says,
"his connection with Dundas was Pitt's great
misfortune."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The first letter is on the subject
of free exports of our manufactures to Holland.</p>


<p><i>Right Hon. Henry Dundas to Mr. Wilberforce.</i></p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Wimbledon</span>, <i>August 15, 1796</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear W.</span>,&mdash;I have spoke both with Mr.
Pitt and Lord Grenville on the subject of a free
exportation of our manufactures from this country
to Holland. I think they agree with me in
thinking that if the restraint was ever a politick
one the time is passed. Lord Liverpool, I believe,
is of a different opinion, but it will immediately
come under discussion, and I would hope he will
act wisely upon it. For my own part, I am of
opinion that it is a degree of infatuation at the
present moment to prevent the trade and manufactures
of the country finding an exit and a vent
in any mode and by any channel the enterprise
of the merchants can devise. I am as well as can
be under all the anxieties which the state of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
country naturally suggests, and the pain arising
from that anxiety is not diminished by feeling
oneself free from the blame of all the mischief
which is going on. Who would have thought not
many years ago that in the year 1796 Great
Britain should be the only nation to be found
true to its own interests, or in a situation to
maintain them. But I find my pen running away
with me, and must conclude with congratulating
you on the fine weather and luxuriant crops, and
with being, my dear Wil,</p>

<p>Dundas's remarks on the defence of the country
and the raising of volunteer and yeomanry corps
in 1798 are not without interest in 1897.</p>


<p>
"<span class="smcap">Wimbledon</span>, <i>January 29, 1798</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Wilberforce</span>,&mdash;There can not be
a doubt of the wishes of Government to bring
forward the zeal and exertions of the country in
every practicable shape; at present I am not
aware that any thing cheaper (if really efficient)
can be resorted to than the system of volunteer
corps and yeomanry corps to which every encouragement
is given. At the same time if any proposal
through the regular channel can be laid before
Government having the same tendency, there can
not be a doubt of its being duly attended to.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
The only satisfactory answer therefore which I
can make to your letter is to suggest to you the
propriety of mentioning to your friends who have
applied to you, that it would be best for them to
put in writing the specified plan they would severally
wish to adopt, and if that is sent to the
Duke of Portland by the Lord Lieutenant, I have
no reason to doubt that it will be duly attended
to. If a copy of the proposal is at the same
time extra officially laid before me, it might be
the means of expediting the consideration of it,
as I have frequent opportunities of conversing
with the Dukes of York and Portland, and likewise
with Mr. Pitt on all subjects of that nature.
Indeed the proper defence of the country by
every possible means it can be done with effect
and economy occupies my unremitting attention,
and if I observe it neglected in any department,
it vexes and distresses me more than I can
describe, and perhaps more than is convenient
consistently with keeping one's mind in a constant
tenor of steady and unruffled attention. I was
sorry to learn within these two days that Mrs.
Wilberforce is ailing, and</p>

<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>In his later days when he had withdrawn to<br />
a great extent from the society which he had<br />
charmed in his youth Wilberforce's chief female<br />
friends were Hannah More, of whose letters hundreds<br />
remain, Martha More, Mrs. Fry, Maria<br />
Edgeworth. In strong contrast stand out the<br />
friendships of the youthful days, when Wilberforce's<br />
Wimbledon villa was the resort of witty<br />
and fashionable, rather than of learned and charitable<br />
ladies, when he was "sitting up all night<br />
singing" and when the society he frequented<br />
included Mrs. Siddons, Mrs. Crewe, Mrs. Sheridan,<br />
the Duchess of Portland, and last but not<br />
least, the beautiful and bewitching Jane Duchess<br />
of Gordon, she who raised the regiment of Gordon<br />
Highlanders by giving, as was said, the<br />
shilling from her mouth to the recruits.<br />
<br />
The Duchess of Gordon writes to William<br />
Wilberforce in July, 1788, of "the many happy<br />
hours I have spent at Wimbledon," and from<br />
Keswick this versatile woman tells him of the<br />
"sweet church" she had passed by and how she<br />
"found myself repeating the lines, 'Remote from<br />
man with God he passed his days, Prayer all<br />
his business, all his pleasure praise': it is thus<br />
I should like to live, the world forgetting, by<br />
the world forgot." She tries to tempt him to<br />
Gordon Castle in these words: "I know that<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>'silent glens have charms for thee,' and this is the<br />
country in which you will find those silent and<br />
peaceful abodes. Nature bestowed every wild,<br />
uncultivated beauty, with a purer air and brighter<br />
horizon. Here Hygeia is to be found; we lead<br />
the lives of hermits. Dr. Beattie shall be our<br />
companion. We go to bed at eleven, and sometimes<br />
visit the majestic ocean before breakfast.<br />
I am certain the air of this country would perfectly<br />
re-establish your health, which would give<br />
joy to thousands, and no one more than, &amp;c.,<br />

</p>


<p>In this letter the Duchess encloses her correspondence
with Dundas, who was one of the
circle at that Liberty Hall of Wimbledon.</p>

<p>The Duchess had had a misunderstanding with
Dundas which she wished Wilberforce to heal
through his influence with Pitt. She had "dropped
some words" respecting Dundas to Pitt which had
"got round" to the former. Dundas writes to
her:</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">India Office</span>,<br />
<br />
"<i>July 4, 1788</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Duchess</span>,&mdash;I received your affectionate
note previous to your departure for Scotland. A
great part of its contents are more fit for discussion
in free conversation than by letter. I have only to
beg of you always to keep in remembrance the
long letter I wrote to you in consequence of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
words you dropped to Mr. Pitt respecting me last
winter.</p>

<p>"It is scarcely possible for you to put me out
of humour, because however much you may at
times forget yourself, and get into sallies of unguarded
expression, you would be almost the
worst of beings if you was seriously to entertain
for me any other sentiments than those of perfect
regard and affection. I therefore never suspect
you of any serious alteration of your regard. But
let me for your own sake entreat you to reflect
that everybody does not make the same allowance
that I do. You judge truly when you think that
you have many enemies, and be assured that there
is no such good receipt for having enemies than to
talk rashly or disrespectfully behind their backs;
and be sure of it these things in some way or
other get round, and no after-civility is received as
an expiation. On the contrary, it brings upon
you the imputation of duplicity which of all other
ingredients in a character ought (even the suspicion
of it) to be avoided.</p>

<p>"After so long a lecture, I think it right to
console you with enclosing Sir George Young's
note just received. I leave you to say anything
you please about me to Mrs. Gordon, only let her
not imagine that I made professions even in the
middle of a country dance without a perfect determination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
to realise them. Remember me affectionately
to everybody, and</p>

<p>
"I remain,<br />
"Yours sincerely,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Henry Dundas.</span>"<br />

<p>The Duchess's answer to Dundas is so full of
piquancy that it helps one to realise the personality
of this remarkable woman.</p>


<p><i>Duchess of Gordon to Right Hon. Henry Dundas.</i></p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Gordon Castle</span>,<br />
"<i>July 13, 1788</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"I have this morning yours, and though not a
little confused with the bustle of joy that surrounds
me, cannot delay answering it. There is something
in the strain of your letters so unlike the ideas that
you convey in our conversation that I cannot think
they are wrote by the same person.</p>

<p>"Why mention duplicity to me? You know
there is not a human being further from it; and
I know you don't in your heart believe one word
upon the subject. If you do, you have not the
penetration the world gives you; for I can assure
you with the firmest confidence you are most egregiously
mistaken. It would be better for me if I
had a little more of that detestable vice, or even
the policy to conceal my sentiments, for I am convinced
my enemies are the offspring of too much
openness; far, very far, from that detested duplicity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
or any of its hateful train. I never expressed an
idea of you or your conduct that I did not express
to yourself. It was the impulse of the moment;
and I feel too independent of any man's power, however
much I may choose to depend upon their good
opinion and friendship, to suppress my sentiments
when justly founded. For many years of my life
my confidence in you was unbounded. You said
you loved me with all the extravagance of passion;
at the same time that respect, esteem, and veneration
made you express sentiments that did you
honour to feel and me to follow. You certainly
did not act to my brother as I would have done
to yours or to anyone you protected. What Mr.
Pitt told you I could not tell him as a secret.
You have often told me he has none from you.
I do not doubt&mdash;I could not doubt&mdash;that the
Duke and I were the persons on earth you wished
most to serve, and yet my brother has met with
the most cruel disappointments. In this, my good
friend, there is no duplicity. Not even to your
enemies did I express an idea that could lead
them to think that I ever doubted your honour,
your sincerity, or your talents as a statesman.
No dark hints and half-sentences; but an open
declaration of my friendship and a dependence
upon yours. That your friends and that society
was where we spent the happiest hours. However<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
impolitic, I always openly declared my decided
preference to those parties, and I don't doubt it
but it made enemies of those that had felt and
expressed very different sentiments&mdash;I know it
did. But to gain one friend such as I could name,
more than repaid a legion of such insipid triflers
and ignorant puppies. When I wrote you my
note from London I had resolved to obliterate all
causes of complaint, and only remember with
gratitude the pleasant parties we had enjoyed at
your house; but your letter makes it necessary
that I bring to your view from how many different
sources any dissatisfaction on my part arose. The
last cause&mdash;your conduct relative to our politics&mdash;I
thought both impolitic as a statesman and unkind
as a friend. You say you thought otherwise, and
your kind proposal of the Duke's succeeding to
Lord Marchmont's office will more than cancel his
disappointment. This is a true picture of my
mind. After eighteen years' acquaintance, you
would have drawn a much more flattering one;
indeed, till the last few months of my life, you
certainly thought me all perfection&mdash;so no more
duplicity, or I must attribute eighteen years of
that most horrid vice to you, and only a few
months' sincerity. So I know, whatever you may
amuse yourself with writing, that it is still, and
must be, your firm belief. I would not have said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
so much upon the subject, but I tremble for I
don't know what. I had hints in London. I had
forgot them, till your letter brings them with
redoubled force to my remembrance. I could not
believe them; for you had convinced me Mr. Pitt
had some unfavourable impressions of me, and
that you had removed them. For no one favour
did I feel more grateful. But I shall never have
done. I was happy to see all your family in
Edinburgh well and happy; I found my little boy
the most lovely creature I ever saw. My Duke
is most sincerely yours; he cannot doubt your
friendship, as that office had long been the object
of his wishes and expectations. No one is better
entitled and no one more worthy of it. Once
more adieu. May the races afford you much
amusement, and may the paths of Melville and
Duneira be strewed with roses, without one care
from public or private life to cause a gloom.</p>

<p>The Duchess, in enclosing this correspondence,
begs Wilberforce to be her defender if he hears
her character attacked on the ground of "duplicity"
or "inaccuracy;" his influence with Pitt
was one reason for her troubling him with the
subject.</p>

<p>Later on she writes to Wilberforce, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
gradually withdrawing himself from fashionable
society, a note docketed "before 1800," to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Am I never to see you more? The Duchess
of Leeds and her sister sing here Monday evening.
Pray come; I shall be delighted to see you, and
much mortified if you don't come.</p>


<p>
"Ever yours most truly, &amp;c.,<br />
"<span class="smcap">J. Gordon.</span>"<br />
</p>

<p>After 1800 Wilberforce seems in great measure
to have cut himself loose from society that he
considered frivolous; and to have used the extraordinary
influence he possessed over his friends to
endeavour to induce them also to forsake the world
of fashion. The long letter which follows is from
Lord Calthorpe (a relation of Barbara,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>&nbsp;Wilberforce's
wife), who had been strongly advised by
Wilberforce not to spend a Sunday with the
Duchess of Gordon in Scotland. Lord Calthorpe
writes in great chagrin at having neglected the
good advice of his mentor, had found the warnings
against her fascinations very necessary, and
had had the mortification of seeing her go to
sleep while he read Leighton's "Commentary" to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
her. It would be of interest to know what were the
"full and useful directions for public speaking" for
which Lord Calthorpe is grateful to Wilberforce.</p>


<p><i>Lord Calthorpe to Mr. Wilberforce.</i></p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Kinrara</span>,<br />
"<i>September 2, 1801, Saturday</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have just evinced a proof of
want of vigilance and self-discipline which vexes me
so much that I am endeavouring to find relief from
my vexation by telling it to you, as it is a satisfaction
to me to think that you will pity me, in spite of
the neglect of your advice, which I have betrayed.
After having had the carriage at the door to leave
this place (the Duchess of Gordon's) in order that
we might spend to-morrow quietly, about twenty
miles off, I have suffered myself to be persuaded to
stay here till Monday. O how subtle are the devices
of the enemy of our peace, and how weak
our natural means of defence; the real cause of my
falling into this temptation is now plain enough, but
the shadow of delusion that for a moment imposed
upon me was the idea of having some serious conversation
with the Duchess, when we were likely to
be almost alone, and which company has hitherto
given me but little opportunity for; and this I was
weak enough to indulge in spite of more sober convictions
and the advice of Mr. Gorham and other
objections, and I am just awakened to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
extent of my folly, conceit, and wilful depravity, by
finding that we are to have no chance of having my
imagination gratified, as Sir Wm. Scott has written
word that he is coming to-morrow, and the delight
with which the Duchess welcomed the intelligence
has opened my eyes to my sottishness in thinking
her sincere in her wish that I might pass a Sunday
with her. I cannot conceive a scene more calculated
to excite feelings of devotion and to expose
worldly vanities than this spot, which is quite lovely,
yet here I have found how strongly the world may
engage the affections; there is something in the
Duchess that pleases, although against the judgment
(perhaps a little in the way of Falstaff), and makes
her entertaining even when she is the subject of
melancholy reflections; indeed, I feel how necessary
your warnings against her fascinations were;
she talked a great deal about her friend Wilberforce,
and threatens you with a letter about me, and
told me all my faults which she intended to report to
you; I have not spent a Sunday (for it is now over)
with so much self-reproach since I came into Scotland.
She seems to be on the same kind of terms with
religion as she is with her Duke, that is, on terms of
great nominal familiarity without ever meeting each
other except in an hotel or in the streets of Edinburgh.
She fell asleep on Sunday while I was
reading to her part of Leighton's Commentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
and awoke with lively expressions of admiration at
what she had not heard; she talks of setting off for
Ireland in a few weeks and of going to London
afterwards, so I hope that she will do no harm at
Edinburgh next winter. I left Kinrara on Monday
and got to Blair at night; I found there more of
ancient stateliness than I have yet seen, and I think
the Duke of Athol is fond of keeping it up; he has
some very fine scenery about him there, and his
other place Dunkeld, which is twenty miles off, is
perhaps more beautiful although less wild and
magnificent. Sir W. Scott (whom I never see
without thinking of you) is on a visiting tour, and
went from Blair with Lord Frederick Campbell to
Lord Melville's and from thence goes to the Duke
of Argyle's and Montrose's back to Edinburgh; he
was very tortuous and amusing. I have written
this by scraps, and am ashamed to have been so
long about it. Many thanks for your last letter,
and especially for your kindness in giving me such
full and useful directions for acquiring a talent for
public speaking; I will endeavour, as far as I am
able, to do justice to them, and I expect to find
your technical lines of great service to me. I believe
that the plan of religious reading which you
mention is the best, and surely I have no small
encouragement to pursue it, and when I am so
great a gainer by its beneficial effects in your case.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
I spent yesterday at Lord Mansfield's, at Scoone,
where the Kings of Scotland used to be crowned;
the old palace has been pulled down, and a very
large Gothic house built upon its site. I hope you
are enjoying health and quiet where you are, and
every other blessing. Give my kindest remembrance
to Mrs. W.</p>

<p>Wilberforce's influence with Pitt was also known
to Maria, Duchess of Gloucester.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> It will be remembered
that Henry William, third son of George
II. (created Duke of Gloucester in 1764), married
Maria, Dowager Countess of Waldegrave, in 1766.
This lady writes to Wilberforce, hoping that through
his "mediation with Pitt" a regiment of dragoons
may be given to her son Lord Waldegrave.</p>


<p><i>The Duchess of Gloucester to Mr. Wilberforce.</i></p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Genoa</span>, <i>February 4, 1786</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Although you did not succeed in one of
my requests to Mr. Pitt, you were more successful
in the other; and for that I return you my thanks.
I did not very much flatter myself that Mr. Pitt
would add a place to what Lord Waldegrave at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
present possesses, indeed a regiment is almost
the only addition he is likely to gain; and as Mr.
Pitt has expressed his satisfaction in the marks of
favour already received from the King, may I hope,
through your mediation, that Mr. Pitt will be so
good as to remind His Majesty how very acceptable
a regiment of dragoons will be to Lord
Waldegrave. If Lord Waldegrave was distressed
from his own extravagance I would not trouble Mr.
Pitt, but my daughter's father left his brother a
clear estate which is now encumbered as much as
if the late Lord Waldegrave had come to the title
and estate, at twenty-four, instead of forty-four.
The Duke of Grafton's reconciliation with his son
is now so old a story that I only mention it as a fact
that I am sensible gives you pleasure? Mr. Pitt
is so much attached to Lord Euston, that I must
take part in an event that I know gives him so
much pleasure. I hope Lord Lucan will suffer
the match to take place, but till it is over I shall
have my doubts. If Mrs. Wilberforce and your
sister are in town will you give them my best
compliments. Sophia and William are both as
tall as yourself.</p>

work on "Practical Christianity."</p>

of what so few people understand. I hope and
trust it will be universally read, and that with

<p>Let us turn to the more serious friendships of
Wilberforce's middle age. So much of his correspondence
with Hannah More has been published
that it is only lightly touched on here.</p>

<p>In 1809 Hannah More wrote to Mr. Wilberforce:
"Oh, if I could have had the benefit of
your assistance in C&oelig;lebs!<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> but I could not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
such an unfeeling brute as to ask it. 'Tis not to
<i>make a speech</i> when I say that <i>you</i> are the <i>only being</i>
whose counsels would <i>in all points</i> have exactly
fallen in with my own ideas from your uniting a
critical knowledge of the world in its higher classes
with such deep religious feelings&mdash;either of these
I might have found in a very few, but not both
in any."</p>

<p>Hannah More and her friends had apparently
unfortunate experiences with regard to the spiritual
help to be obtained from the higher ranks of the
clergy at that time, as she writes: "I have had
many interviews with Ladies Waldegrave and
Euston. They told me that, though acquainted
with several bishops, they never could get a word
of seriousness or profit from any of them."
Whether it was the "critical knowledge of the
world in its higher classes" joined to "deep
religious feeling" mentioned by Hannah More, or
the "indulgent benevolent temper, with no pretension
to superior sanctity or strictness," of which
Maria Edgeworth writes,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> certain it is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Wilberforce became a guide of the religious life
of many of his friends. For instance, Mr. Eliot,
the brother-in-law of Pitt, writes from Burton
Pynsent a letter, marked "very pleasing and
serious" by Wilberforce, in which he says in
answer to Wilberforce, who "hoped he had been
going on in a regular, steady way," that he had
been "endeavouring to work a good will into a
good habit, that so the habit may come in turn
to the assistance of the will, which, as you very
truly say, I am sure (except under the special
favour of God's grace), will flag and waver in its
best pursuits and firmest intention. My chief
reading for the month has been Warburton."</p>

<p>Mrs. Elizabeth Fry writes to Wilberforce to
say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When thou hast leisure, advise with me as
with a child if thou hast any hint to give me in
my new circumstances. I look before long once
more to entering the prisons. The cause is near my
heart, and I do not see that my husband, having
lost his property, should, when he and my family
do not want me, prevent my yet attending to these
duties; in this I should like to have thy advice."</p>

<p>In 1801 the question of Irish Union divided
educated opinion. Dr. Burgh,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> a well-known man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
at this time and friend of Wilberforce, takes one
side, and Lord Hardwicke, Viceroy of Ireland, the
other.</p>


<p>
<i>Dr. Burgh to Mr. Wilberforce.</i><br />
<br />
"<span class="smcap">York</span>, <i>February 9, 1801</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Wilber.</span>,&mdash;I sincerely thank you for
the communication you have made to me, and
assure you that you may rely upon my profoundest
silence. The cruel and corrupt means that were
adequately resorted to, in order to effect the revolutionary
Union which has subverted the prescriptive
constitution of both these kingdoms, have so
entirely infected the sweetness of affiance in my
bosom, that whatever systems or changes are
adopted my eye sets instantly to search among all
possible motives in order to find the worst of
issues. Can I see Addington climb upon the
stooping neck of Mr. Pitt, and not believe that it
is done in hostility, or in a masked confederacy?
If the former, how am I to estimate the man who
comes in? If the latter, what judgment can I form
of the man who goes out? Is a retiring administration
to be allowed, in a temporary agreement
with opposition, to support the claims of Irish
Popery, and by carrying their point in their new
character, to exonerate the Cabinet of the charge;
and are they to re-occupy their posts when there
are no farther measures to be carried by them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
their unresponsible situations? All this I foresaw,
though not perhaps in the detail; and, indeed, it
required no prophet's eye to foresee it, when hints
which bind not were conscientiously substituted for
promises in order to purchase a momentary calm.
The downfall of the Church of England is still
involved, and however the Papists of Ireland, on
merging the two kingdoms into each other, may be
considered as outnumbered by the Protestants, it
is not by the Protestants of the Establishment,
who will, on the whole, be outweighed by the
incorporated force of the Protestant Dissenters
with those of the same description in Ireland, who
will derive the most unqualified assistance from the
Romish body. Show favour to Popery, and the
Dissenters' claims will be abetted by millions who
will only infer a kind of right against all anticipation
of consequences; or, on the other hand, deny
the demands of Popery, and you instantly and
directly unite the two denominations against the
Church of England. I know but one mode to
prevent all these, and ten thousand other unconsidered
evils; at once declare the impracticability of
carrying conditions into execution, and dissolve
this ill-starred Union, from which no benefit will
ever flow, but every evil that imagination can
picture.</p>

<p>"I will trouble you no farther now except to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
desire that you will not charge me with defective
candour; the things that are already done will
surely too clearly justify whatever inference I have
drawn from them.</p>

<p>"May every happiness attend you and yours&mdash;in
opposition to prospects I say it; but if a few good
men may not save a nation, they yet may save
and purchase favour to themselves.</p>

<p>"I think the alterations made by the Union are
in some respects likely to facilitate the conduct
of public business in this country with a view to
the public benefit. I have hitherto had great
reason to be satisfied with my reception. The
city of Dublin, I mean the leading part of it, is
extremely loyal and attached to Government, but
they still consider the Union as having affected
in some degree their local interests, and it will
be some time before this feeling is entirely
removed. There can however be little doubt that
when they see the United Parliament as attentive
to Irish as they have been to British interests,
and disposed to promote them by the same liberal
encouragement, that whatever partial dissatisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
may remain will gradually wear off. If the French
do not succeed in landing a considerable body
of troops in this country we shall certainly continue
to enjoy tranquillity, but if the enemy effect
a landing in force, we must expect rebellion to
revive."</p>

<p>The state of Ireland at a later date after the
Union is alluded to in the next letter from Lord
Redesdale,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> who was apparently much aggrieved
at the treatment which he had experienced in
giving up the Lord Chancellorship of that country.
The letter is marked by Wilberforce "Lord
Redesdale shamefully used on being turned out
of Chancellorship."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I rely upon your letter,
desiring to know whether there was any establishment
in this country by contribution to which
you could forward its civilisation, for excusing
my sending you 'observations on the necessity
of publishing the Scriptures in the Irish language,'
by Dr. Stokes, of the College, who is engaged
in such a work, without any view of emolument,
but merely to promote the civilisation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
country, and the propagation, as much as possible,
of the Christian religion in its purity. He is
supported by contribution of the college, and
some private contributions; but such is the temper
of the Irish that even their charities, liberal as
they frequently are, are more the result of pride
and vanity than of any of the true feelings of
the charitable mind. I think Dr. Stokes's work
will be very useful; and that in spite of all
the arts of the priests, the circulation of the
Scriptures will prevail amongst the lower orders,
and must reform even the Irish Catholic Church,
which I take to be the most corrupt now
remaining of all the members of the Church of
Rome. It will also have the effect of enabling
the Protestant clergy of the Establishment to
perform their duty; namely, to endeavour to
instruct those who do not understand the English
language; and I think it will also enable the
gentlemen of the country to gain so much of
the Irish language as will give them some intercourse
with their poor neighbours, where the English
language is not spoken; and I think it will also
contribute to diffuse the English language, which
I think is a most important advantage. I have
thought it my duty to subscribe ten guineas for
the encouragement of Dr. Stokes, and I believe
a few subscriptions with what the College proposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
to give him, will encourage him to proceed
with activity; as I have strong assurances that
he seeks for nothing but indemnity and desires
no compensation for his time or his labour. I
yesterday gave up the Great Seal, in consequence
of Lord Spencer's having thought fit to advise
His Majesty, after he had signed a warrant for
Mr. Ponsonby's appointment, to sign another for
putting the Great Seal in commission, and then
to send it <i>by express</i>, directing the Lord Lieutenant
to <i>lose no time</i> in procuring the Commission
to pass the Seal. This has been done in so much
hurry that I have great doubts of its regularity;
and if it had been the case of any man but
myself, I should have refused to put the Great
Seal to the patent, without further consideration;
and I find the Lords Commissioners are very
much puzzled how to act. But this I feel principally
as a marked and gross personal affront
to me, and through me to the Lord Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"I could do nothing (without the Lord Lieutenant's
warrant) but despatch the business of the
Court of Chancery; and yet I am not to be
trusted with the Great Seal <i>for a few days</i> till
the arrival of Mr. Ponsonby for that purpose;
and the suitors of the Court of Chancery were
to be equally injured; for the Commissioners
being the Chief Justice and Chief Baron, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
have too much business in their own courts to
sit in the Court of Chancery, and the Master of
the Rolls who cannot (from the state of his health)
do more business than he does as Master of the
Rolls, very little of the business which would have
been dispatched by me can be done till the arrival
of Mr. Ponsonby; and by that time all the
counsel will be gone the circuit. I must confess
I resent this wanton and childish insult (for I
have no doubt the affront was intended by Lord
Spencer) much more than my removal from my
office, and nothing could be more insulting than
the terms of the letters written by my old friend
C. W. Wynne, by order of Lord Spencer, with
the directions to have the patent to the Commissioners
sealed forthwith. From Lord Spencer
and from Wynne I had certainly a claim at least
to personal civility. But it is the miserable effect
of party violence to blind all those who suffer
themselves to be led by it. I have the satisfaction
of knowing that all those persons here whose
good opinion is of any value regret my removal,
and have given me most affectionate testimonies
of their regard. I am sorry to add that the
conduct of His Majesty's ministers, in various
instances, has raised in the Protestant inhabitants
of this country great and serious alarm.
The expressions of Mr. Fox on the subject of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
the Union have sunk deep into their minds; and
though it has been contrived to quiet those adverse
to the Union for the moment, with a view to
prevent alarm, the poison is working in their
minds, and you will probably soon perceive its
effects. Mr. Fox's answer to Lord Shrewsbury
and Mr. Scully, as stated in the papers, has
also had a very unfortunate effect. It is a libel
on the Government of the country in all its
parts; imputing to it gross partiality even in the
administration of justice, and it promises the
Roman Catholics a different order of things; not
by the interposition of the legislature, but <i>by the
influence and favour of the executive</i> government;
and it applies itself directly and particularly to
the <i>army</i>, as if it were intended to frighten the
Protestants into acquiescence. It should be recollected
that Lord Shrewsbury is not connected in
any way with Ireland, except by a claim of
peerage; and that Mr. Scully is the author of a
pamphlet in which he writes of James the Second
as <i>the lawful King of Ireland</i> at the battle of
the Boyne, and King William as a <i>Dutch invader</i>.
You can have no conception of the gloom
which prevails in the minds of thinking people
in this country. Our Chief Justice and Chief
Baron, both very sound men and highly esteemed,
are very strongly affected. The Chief Justice forebodes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
every species of mischief. Lord Norbury,
who is Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, is
of a lighter turn of mind, and irritated by a gross
and ridiculous affront in omitting his name in the
Commission for custody of the Great Seal&mdash;evidently
a mere piece of party malice. But he also
is full of gloomy apprehensions of the result of
the measures likely to be adopted.</p>

<p>"But my apprehensions are greatly increased
by observing that Lord Grenville and Lord
Spencer are mere dupes to the other party in
the Cabinet with respect to Ireland, if not
generally so. Lord Grenville and Lord Spencer
perhaps imagine that they may have some
influence in Ireland through Mr. Elliott and Sir
J. Newport. Most certainly they will have none.
The Ponsonby family will govern Ireland through
the Lord Lieutenant, who is completely in their
hands. Lord Grenville and Lord Spencer seem
also to have put Scotland and India out of their
control; and with the influence of all the great
appendages of the Empire against them, and a
majority in the Cabinet to contend with at home,
what can they hope for? As the least of two
evils, I shall yet feel it my duty to support them
against their rivals in the Cabinet, though the
personal insults I have received have come through
them, and their rivals have been comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
civil. I shall get rid of my property here as soon
as I can, and with the miserable remains transport
myself to England for the rest of my days.</p>

<p>"I have had enough of office, and especially in
my last change, which has had the effect of
making me pay a fine of at least twenty thousand
pounds for the honour of serving four years
in a laborious office, separated from my family
and all my old friends, I shall return to England,
however, with pleasure; for though I shall be
reduced to practise an economy to which for
thirty years I have been a stranger, I shall return
to my old friends, and to a country where my life
will probably be in no greater danger than that
of any other person, and where Lady Redesdale
will be relieved from the fear and anxieties which
have long agitated her mind, and made her
ardently wish that I had never taken the office
of Chancellor of Ireland; a wish in which I most
heartily concur. The remainder of my life I trust
will be passed more quietly than the last three
years. Lady Redesdale begs to join in respects
to Mrs. Wilberforce, and I am</p>

which is surely the greatest question and interest
connected with this Empire. There is no man
in England who from activity, understanding,
character, and neutrality could do it so effectually as
Mr. Wilberforce&mdash;and when this country conceded
a century ago an establishment to the Presbyterian
Church, it is horrible to see four millions of
Christians of another persuasion instructed by
ragged priests, and praising their Creator in wet

<p>Wilberforce had evidently written to Lord Eldon
begging him not to take up the great question of
abolition of slavery on party grounds; and Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Eldon wrote that he wished that the House of
Lords might not disgrace itself by its mode of
proceeding, as he saw a strong inclination to do
justice, "if abolition be justice, in a most unjust
mode." This letter is undated; it was probably
written in 1802.</p>

<p><i>Lord Eldon to Mr. Wilberforce.</i></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I thank you for your book, and
I add my thanks for your letter. You may be
assured that I am incapable of 'taking up this
great question on party grounds.' As a proof
of that, I may mention that after listening more
than once, with the partiality which my love of his
virtues created, to Mr. Pitt himself in the House of
Commons, and discussing the subject with him in
private, again and again, the difficulties which I
had upon immediate abolition, and abolition without
compensation previously pledged (not compensation
for British debts out of African blood, but out of
British treasure) never were so far surmounted, as
to induce me to think I had clear grounds for voting
<i>with him</i>. After such a statement, I need not say
that, although my political life has, at least so I
fancy, for near twenty-four years been so far really
regulated by a sincere belief that I am acting
according to the dictates of duty in an uniform uninterrupted
opposition to some persons now in power
that I feel it very difficult to class among my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
honourable friends gentlemen who have never, that
I know of, disavowed the principles against which I
have been waging war, and who, I presume, have
never disavowed them because they entertained
them, as sincerely as I detest them; yet, in a case of
this sort, I know that I must either stand or fall by
taking diligent heed that in what I do or forbear to
do I am governed by the best lights, which my own
reason, aided by information, can afford me; and I
should think myself a worse man, if I was influenced
by party considerations in such a business, than
indiscreet zeal has yet represented a West India
planter to be.</p>

<p>"What I shall finally do I know not. I wish the
House of Lords may not disgrace itself by its mode
of proceeding. I see or think I see a strong inclination,
if abolition be justice, to do justice in a most
unjust mode. Perhaps the dilatory conduct of that
House formerly, it is now thought, can be atoned
for by hurry and precipitation. And that its character
will be best maintained by its being doubly
disgraced. I wish my mind had been so framed as
to feel no doubts on this awful and fearful business,
but as that is not the case, I must endeavour to do
as rightly as, with my infirmities of mind I may be
able to act. I shall see to-day what course the
matters take, and if my view of the subject leads me
to determine to vote and I feel it likely to be beneficial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
to converse upon facts, as well as to read all I
can find, I shall seek the benefit you kindly offer me.</p>

<p>Wilberforce had met Lord Ellenborough on the
Continent in 1785, and had maintained a friendly
intercourse with him. The following letter from
Lord Ellenborough shows his attitude towards
abolition. Though he acknowledged the viciousness
of the system he was extremely alarmed at the
consequences of disturbing it (especially in the then
convulsed state of the world). At the same time he
said that he should not be governed by any supposed
policy of man, if he were clear as to the will of God
on the point. His letter is marked "truly pleasing"
by Wilberforce.</p>

"<span class="smcap">Bloomsbury Square</span>,<br />

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I recollect perfectly the conversation
between us in the House of Commons to
which you allude, and should be extreme happy to
appoint a time when I might have the benefit, which
I should certainly derive from a communication with
you upon the important subject mentioned in your
letter,&mdash;if I could do so with convenience to you,
and without breaking in upon my necessary attendance
during the sittings at Westminster and Guildhall&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
which occupy me from half-past eight to
four or later every day&mdash;and on some days I am
afterwards obliged to attend the House of Lords
till between five and six. If there be any morning
this week during which my sittings will continue
at Westminster, when it might be convenient to you
to be at my chamber at Westminster, called the
King's Bench Treasury Chamber, by half-past eight,
I would be down there by that time, which would
allow me the satisfaction of seeing you for half
hour before my sittings, which commence at nine,
begin. I feel the infinite importance of the question
of abolition, and will give no vote upon it at all,
unless I can do so with a much more satisfied judgment
and conscience on the subject than I have
attained at present. I have always felt a great
abhorrence of the mode by which these unfortunate
creatures are torn from their families and country,
and have doubted whether any sound policy could
grow out of a system which seemed to be so vicious
in its foundation; but I am extremely alarmed at the
consequences of disturbing it, particularly in the
present convulsed state of the world. In short, my
dear sir, I am almost ashamed to say that I tremble
at giving their full effect to the impressions which
the subject naturally makes on my mind, in the first
view of it, as a man and a Christian. I am frightened
at the consequences of any innovation upon a long-established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
practice, at a period so full of danger as
the present. At the same time I cannot well reconcile
it with the will of God,&mdash;and if I was quite clear on
that head, I should be decided by it, and should not
be governed by any supposed policy of man which
might be set up in opposition to it. I write this in
confidence to yourself. I remain, my dear sir, with
very sincere respect,</p>

<p>Wilberforce had written to Lord Ellenborough on
the evils of his having a seat in the Cabinet, Lord
Ellenborough being at that time Lord Chief Justice
of the King's Bench, and the next letter contains
Lord Ellenborough's defence of his conduct, which
does not err on the side of brevity and which
Wilberforce describes as "a very handsome answer."</p>

"<span class="smcap">Bloomsbury Square</span>,<br />
"<i>February 4, 1806</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I sit down to thank you for the
favour of your letter in the very instant in which I
have received it. I regret very much that I have no
opportunity of personal communication with you on
the subject of it: if I had I could explain more perfectly
and unreservedly than I can do by letter all
the motives which have induced my reluctant acquiescence
in a nomination of myself to a place in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
Cabinet. The situation has not only not been sought
by me, but I appeal to every member of the Government
about to be formed who is acquainted with the
transaction, whether it was not accepted by me with
extreme reluctance, and after objections raised by
myself which nothing but a superior sense of the
present duty and a prospect of present usefulness to
the public would have surmounted. If I had felt
that a situation in the Cabinet would have placed me
under circumstances inconsistent with the due and
impartial discharge of my judicial functions, no consideration
on earth would have induced me to accept
it. A member of the Cabinet is only a member of a
Select Committee of the Privy Council, of which
Privy Council at large every justice of the K.B. is of
course a member. In that larger Privy Council his
Majesty may and frequently does take the opinion
of its members on matters which may come in question
judicially before some of them. But I think
that no man can correctly act in both capacities, and
therefore when a question of a high criminal nature
was about a year ago under discussion at a Privy
Council at which I was particularly desired by the
Chancellor to attend, I stipulated expressly with my
Lord Chancellor that I should not be included in a
Special Commission to try the offence then under
consideration. I think both my Lord C. J. Holt,
and very lately my Lord C. J. Eyre would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
done better to have forborne being present at the
preliminary inquiries before the Privy Council, the
subjects of which in the result might be, and afterwards
in fact were, tried before them; but the objection
is not so much in my opinion that I might be
led to participate in the counsels of the Executive
Government upon questions connected with the
criminal jurisdiction which I am to exercise elsewhere
(because from these I should of course invariably
withdraw myself) but because it might give
a political cast and bias to a judicial mind, might
generate views of ambition, and destroy that indifference
and impartiality on all questions which is the
proper characteristic of a British judge, and even if
it had not that effect, it might be supposed by the
world at large to produce it, which very opinion of
others would detract much from the public credit
and consequent usefulness of the person so circumstanced.</p>

<p>"The consideration of this objection at first gave
my mind no small degree of anxiety. I was conscious
to myself that I had no views of ambition to gratify.
Those views, if I had entertained any such, would
have been better consulted by accepting the Great
Seal, and with it a highly efficient place in the public
Councils&mdash;but which I had already refused&mdash;indeed
every view of that kind has been long since more
than satisfied. I lent myself at the earnest solicitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
of others to the great public object of forming
a strong and united administration, which,
perhaps, without my consent to accept this situation
could not, from particular circumstances and
difficulties which I am not at liberty to state, have
been formed.</p>

<p>"In accepting it I have stipulated that I should not
be expected to attend except on particularly important
occasions, and on such occasions some of my
predecessors and particularly Lord Mansfield has, I
understand, been called upon for his advice, and
indeed, in virtue of my oath as Privy Councillor I
am bound to give that advice when required.</p>

<p>"Will you acquit me of vanity?&mdash;I hope you will,
when I give one reason more for my consenting to
become for a time (I hope it will be a short one) an
ostensible member of his Majesty's select and confidential
Council. As I had, so I hoped I should be
understood to have, no motive of ambition or interest
inducing me to take this place in his Majesty's
Councils. I had in general been supposed on most
subjects to think for myself. I had, I believe, been
considered in general as a zealous friend to the just
prerogatives of the Crown. I had no particular stain
upon my private character: in the miscellaneous
composition of every administration, and of this,
amongst others, I thought a person such as I might
be esteemed to be, and on the ground of that estimation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
particularly, would be an ingredient not wholly
without its use.</p>

<p>"So it appeared to some of my friends. So it
did (I speak it in confidence) particularly to Lord
Sidmouth, as to the purity of whose views and
conduct in the formation of the present arrangement
I can bear the fullest testimony, and whose earnest
request (I speak it still in the same confidence)
overcame my reluctance, and induced me to make
this sacrifice of private convenience and to incur
the hazard which your kind and honourable letter
represents to me as greater than I had thought it,
of suffering in the good opinion of others. If, after
this explanation, unavoidably less perfect than I
could have wished to make it, you shall still retain
your unfavourable opinion of the step I have taken,
I shall learn it from you (and I am sure in that case
you will have the frankness to tell me so) with
inexpressible pain. As long as I shall continue a
member of his Majesty's Councils (and I hope the
necessity which induced my acceptance of the
situation will not be of long continuance) I will
give a faithful, honest, and fearless opinion upon
the subjects under consideration, and, although it is
possible that good men may doubt of the prudence
or propriety of my conduct in accepting it, I am
confident that no good man who shall have the
means of knowing the actual course I shall pursue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
in that situation will have reason to blame it. The
explanation I have given you is entirely confidential.
With an anxious wish consistently to perform
all the various duties which press upon me at this
moment and to preserve the good opinion of good
men, and especially of one whom on many accounts
I have so long and so highly esteemed as yourself,</p>

<p>In 1802, on the supposition that Lord Wellesley's
resignation as Governor-General of India was imminent,
an idea had been entertained that Lord
Castlereagh should be offered the Governor-Generalship,
and Wilberforce had been asked to
approach him on the subject. From Lord Camden's
letter to Wilberforce, given below, it will be seen
that Pitt had objected to an appointment that
would take Lord Castlereagh from the House of
Commons, which he thought should be the theatre
of his future fame.</p>

should have been confined to London by the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
anxious attendance you have undergone. I thank
you for communicating with me on the subject of
Lord Castlereagh, and I will explain to you all I
know of his objects as connected with the situation
you have mentioned.</p>

<p>"Amongst the many unpleasant circumstances
attending our secession from office I have considered
Lord Castlereagh's actual situation as one
peculiarly awkward to himself, and I have also
thought that in the present dearth of men of spirit
and sense who <i>can</i> take office it was unfortunate for
the country that he should be excluded. With a
view of relieving him, if possible, from such exclusion,
I contrived that he should meet Pitt here about
a month ago, and have a full and explicit conversation
with him and me relative to the future views of
the one and the future prospects of the other. (I
confess I was not indifferent at the same time to
the consideration of the line I may myself hereafter
think it right to adopt.) In a previous conversation
I had with Pitt respecting Lord Castlereagh, he
expressed his anxiety that he should take office, and
he is desirous of contriving it if possible with credit
to him; and amongst the objects to which Lord
Castlereagh might look, he took notice to me of an
idea which he knew had been entertained of sending
him to the East Indies as Governor-General.
He (Pitt), however, expressed an objection to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
appointment, as it would take him from the House
of Commons, which <i>he</i> thought should be the
theatre of his future fame, and where, whenever
Lord Hawkesbury is removed, he will be much
wanted. In preparing Lord Castlereagh for his
conversation with Pitt I mentioned to him the idea
which had been entertained of his going to India,
but I took notice of it as a mere floating idea that
had not been matured, and in the short conversation
upon that part of the subject which ensued, his
impression appeared to be an unwillingness to
banish himself from his country and to withdraw
for ever (as he should conceive he did, by now
abandoning it) from the situation he had a right to
look for in the House of Commons. In the subsequent
conversation with Pitt at which I was
present, not a word passed on this subject, and
I should therefore conceive that Lord Castlereagh
has never had the subject fairly before him. I am
convinced he would have communicated with me if
he had; and although I should conceive it very
doubtful if the event might turn out as you wish, if
the proposition were made to him, I yet think if
the directors of the East India Company have
really thought of him, he ought to have the opportunity
of weighing a subject of this great importance
in his mind before he has been understood
to decline the offer. By way of apprising Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Castlereagh upon the subject I will enclose him
your letter (if you have no objection), which I think
will give him the opinion of a person indifferent to
everything concerning him except his public character,
and open the business in as advantageous
a manner as it can be done.</p>

<p>In 1803 the tardiness of our military preparations
had been accentuated in a debate on the second
reading of the Army Reserve Bill. Windham, of
whom Wilberforce says that "he had many of the
true characteristics of a hero, but he had one great
fault as a statesman, he hated the popular side of
any question," gives as his opinion in the next
letter, that he saw no impossibility in two armies
of from twenty to thirty thousand men being
landed in different places, and being opposed only
by yeomanry and volunteers they might advance
to London or wherever else they pleased.
"Government acknowledge that there is an utter
want of firearms."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Windham's hope was that
Buonaparte might, for some reason or other, not
come; though he confesses that he did not know
of any foundation for such hope.</p>

"<i>August 18, 1803</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Wilberforce</span>,&mdash;The breaking up of
Parliament, advanced as the season is, I can hardly
help regretting on another account. One wants a
means of publishing the abominable backwardness in
which things are with respect to defence: so as literally
to put us in the situation, described by some
writer in the <i>Moniteur</i>, namely that if fifty thousand
men can anyhow get on shore, they must conquer
the island. What shall we say to the fact, that at the
end of now more than five months since the King's
message not a single ball cartridge (I suppose) has
been fired from one end of the country to the other,
unless perhaps a few that I have desired to be fired
just by me in Norfolk, and some that I hear Grey has
been using upon the same principle in Northumberland?&mdash;that
the corps, which have been raising,
such as they are, remain to this moment for the
greater part without arms?&mdash;that excepting, I am
afraid, a very few thousand men to the army of
reserve, not the smallest addition has been or can
be made to a force truly regular, such as can alone
be opposed upon equal terms to the troops by which
we shall be invaded?&mdash;and that the whole assistance,
that would be to be received from works, of
whatever sort, is all yet to be begun, and even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
settled? When men talk of the difficulties and
impracticability of invasion, of the impossibility of
conquering a country such as this, they say what
may be true, but which is certainly not so for any
reasons which they can, or at least which they do,
give. It is all a kind of loose, general vague
notion founded on what they have been accustomed
to see and to conceive, to which the answer is that
so was everything which we have seen successively
happen for these last fourteen years. Considering
things not in much detail, but upon principles somewhat
less general than those which I have been
alluding to, I can see no impossibility in the supposition
of two armies landing in different places of
from twenty to thirty thousand men each, of their
beating, severally, the troops immediately opposed
to them, and that having nothing then to encounter
but volunteers and yeomanry, and other troops of
this description, in the midst of all the confusion
and panick which would then prevail, that they
might advance to London or wherever else they
pleased. What the further consequences might
be, one has no pleasure in attempting to trace; but
I should be obliged to anyone who would show
me some distinct limits to them. The persons to
do this are, I am sure, not those who talk so glibly
of crushing and overwhelming, and smothering, and
I know not what all; without the least idea how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
any of these things are to be done, while the
persons attacking us know how these things are,
sometimes at least, not done, by the example
of the numerous countries which they have overrun
in spite of all such threatened opposition.
I shall go from here, that is from London, as soon
as I have settled some necessary business, and see
whether I can be of any use in Norfolk, though I
do not perceive how with the aid of only a single
regiment of militia (all our present force) we are to
stop a body of even one thousand men, or how for
the present, anything at all can be done, when there
is not as yet a provision for even the delivery of
arms. All the firelocks which they have as yet got
immediately about here have been sent down at my
own expense. My chief hopes are I confess that
Buonaparte may, for some reason or another, not
come, or at least for some time; but what foundation
there is for any such hope I confess I do not
know. Forgive my running on at this rate. The
importance of the subject would certainly warrant
me if I had anything new to say.</p>

<p>"I had certainly felt it my duty (as only following
up the plan proposed before I came to the
Ordnance) to endeavour to restore at the Peace,
and with such improvements as could be suggested,
the manufacture of the old Tower musquet, which
our troops used to have, but which the necessities
of the late war, and the naked state of our arsenals
at its commencement, had obliged us to depart from,
and to have recourse to an inferior arm. I found
of course considerable opposition to any improvement,
not only from the manufacturers, but from all
the inferior servants of the Ordnance. This was,
however, nearly surmounted, and the manufacture
of the better sort of arm on the point of taking
place, when this sudden and unprecedented demand
for arms took place. I ought here to state that had
it not been with a view to improvement, and intending
gradually to dispose of those of inferior quality
through the medium of the India Company, we
should not have been, previous to the war breaking
out, carrying on any manufacture of arms, our
arsenals being overflowing, calculating on the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
extended scale the Department had ever been called
upon to furnish. I have, however, in consequence
of the extraordinary calls of the present crisis,
determined to use every effort to meet it, and
directions have been given to the Board of
Ordnance to revert to the same arm as was made
last war, and to manufacture to the utmost possible
extent the musquet of the India pattern. You will
easily believe I must have felt some reluctance in
being obliged to take this step after all the pains I
have bestowed, but I hope I have judged for the
best. I have great satisfaction in thinking that
the stock of arms we possess will enable us in the
first instance, to arm to a considerable extent perhaps
all that is really useful, and as arms come in,
which with the exertions of the manufacturers they
will do quickly, and with the aid of what we expect
from abroad the remainder will be provided before
long. We have already one hundred thousand
pikes, and can increase them rapidly, but in general
there is an indisposition to take them. I should
like much to talk over with you, not only the subject
of arms, but the whole question of volunteering
which I contemplate as a most serious one. Excuse
great haste with which I have written, and

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Wilberforce</span>,&mdash;Upon perusing the
French papers I am well satisfied with the conduct
of our Government. The tone is firm and uniform,
and the demands such that we might have felt
extremely happy to have made peace if we could
have obtained them. There is somewhat of a
blundering about the basis, which you will recollect
Lord Malmesbury wrote so much ingenious nonsense
about upon a former occasion, and it is to be
lamented that Mr. Fox (whose letters upon the
whole do him great honour) laid down an indistinct
and indefinite basis in general terms of loose construction
instead of binding that Proteus, his friend
Talleyrand, to whom in his first address he professes
the most perfect <i>attachment</i> (what a word from a
Minister not born in the days of Charles II.!)
to the sense in which he meant to interpret,
fairly as I think, his words, and the words of his
master.</p>

and double dealing of the French negotiators,

<p>
<i>Lord Harrowby to Mr. Wilberforce.</i><br />
<i>Friday, September 22, 1809.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Wilberforce</span>,&mdash;You must have thought
me a great bear not to have thanked you sooner
for your kind recollection of my wish to see a
sketch of Mrs. H. More's rustic building. It is
much more finished than I wished, and shall be sent
to Kensington as soon as Mrs. Ryder has taken a
slight sketch of it.</p>

<p>"I have, since I received it, taken two journies
into Devonshire, upon Maynooth business, and
have not had, when in town, a spare moment from
Indian and domestic torments. The history of the
latter could not be put upon paper, and if it could,
would be as voluminous as an Indian despatch.
You know enough of the parties not to suspend
your opinion till you know as much as is necessary
to form it. The Duke of Portland's resignation has
only accelerated the crisis, and you know enough of
Perceval to be sure that we are not broken up,
because <i>he</i> insists upon having the whole power in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
his own hands, and will not serve under any third
person. Under these circumstances, and a thousand
others, there seemed no resource left, but to attempt
an overture to Lord Grey and Grenville jointly,
which is made with the King's consent and
authority. If it is met in the spirit in which it is
made, I trust it will be successful. Whatever we
may be <i>driven</i> to do, if they shut their ears to the
proposal of an extended and combined administration,
we shall not, in my opinion, have been justified
in our own eyes or in those of the country, if any
party feelings prevented us from <i>endeavouring bonâ
fide</i> to form such a Government as may both protect
the King, and be fit for these times. They are, I
believe, as little able to form a separate Government
as ourselves, unless they mean to re-unite themselves
with those at whose proceedings they were
so evidently alarmed last year. If they come in
alone by force, they will have the Catholic question
as a millstone round their necks. The very fact of
an union with us who are known to entertain a
decidedly opposite opinion upon that question (some
of us for ever, and all during the King's life) would
enable them to get rid of it for the present, as,
without any pledge, which, after all that has passed,
could neither be asked nor given, that question
could never be made a Government question without
the immediate dissolution of the administration.</p>

<p>Lord Erskine writes in 1813, to Wilberforce:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I cannot sufficiently discharge a duty I owe to
the public without telling you what I think of the
speech you sent me on the Christian question in
India. The subject, though great and important,
was local and temporary; but the manner in which
you treated it made your speech of the greatest
value in the shield of Christianity that eloquence
and faith could possibly have manufactured.</p>

<p>"I read it with the highest admiration, and as I
am now a private man for the remaining years of
my life, I may say, without the presumption of
station to give weight to my opinion, that it
deserves a place in the library of every man of
letters, even if he were an atheist, for its merit
in everything that characterises an appeal to a
Christian assembly on the subject of Christianity.
With the greatest regard I ever am,</p>

<p>Rowland Hill, the celebrated preacher, the
disciple of Whitefield, and the founder of the
Surrey Chapel, writes to bring before Wilberforce's
notice the question of "untaxed worship," with
regard to his chapel.</p>

<p><i>Rev. Rowland Hill to Mr. Wilberforce.</i></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Surrey Church</span>,</p>

<p>"<i>April 16, 1814</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear sir</span>,&mdash;Another prosecution for poor
rates on our chapel has commenced. Though the
appellant, Mr. Farquarson, a man of no character
and involved in debt, is the ostensible person, yet
all the evil arises from a Mr. Whitlock, who has a
place in the lottery office under Government, who
probably might have been quiet had he received a
hint from the Government that his designs were not
correspondent with their wishes. As matters are,
the most vexatious and perplexing consequences
must be the result. Different persons are subp&oelig;na'd
down as far as Rygate, while these large expenses
<i>a third time over</i> is the least of the evil that must
result. If they gain a verdict, for the sake of
thousands of religious people that must be ruined
by such a taxation, we must and shall resist.
Surely the present mild Government will not suffer
us to be deprived of the privilege of untaxed
worship that we have uninterruptedly so long enjoyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"If, dear sir, you could but hint to Mr. Vansittart
what must be the result of his neglecting to answer
our respectful petitions so as to obtain some redress
on our behalves, thousands would have to bless you,
and none more so than</p>

<p>
"Yours most respectfully,<br />

</p>


<p>"It should appear according to the new French
constitution that our religious liberties in England are
soon likely to be much inferior to those in France.</p>

<p>"We humbly conceive we have some little claim
on the attention of the Government against these
vexatious disputes, having made the largest collection
of any place of worship in the kingdom on
different patriotic calls."</p>

<p>It will be remembered that when the Duke of
Wellington was ambassador to Paris in 1814 he
took up very warmly the question of the Slave
Trade, himself circulating in Paris Wilberforce's
letter to his Yorkshire constituents on the subject,
which Madam de Staël had translated at the Duke's
suggestion, and also undertaking to disperse Wilberforce's
pamphlet to Talleyrand. The Duke writes
from Paris, December 14, 1814.</p>


<p><i>The Duke of Wellington to Mr. Wilberforce.</i></p>

<p>"It is impossible to describe the prejudice of all
classes here upon the subject, particularly those of
our determined enemies, the principal officers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
<i>employés</i> in the public departments. I was in
hopes that the King's measures had changed the
public opinion in some degree, of which the silence
of the public journals appeared an evidence. But I
found yesterday that I was much mistaken and that
the desire to obtain the gain expected in the trade
is surpassed only by that of misrepresenting our
views and measures, and depreciating the merit we
have in the abolition. I was yesterday told gravely
by the Directeur de la Marine that one of our objects
in abolishing the Slave Trade was to get recruits to
fight our battles in America! and it was hinted that
a man might as well be a slave for agricultural
labour as a soldier for life, and that the difference
was not worth the trouble of discussing it."</p>

<p>The Duke goes on to complain that what was
taking place in Paris as to the Slavery question had
got into the English newspapers.</p>

<p><i>The Duke of Wellington to Mr. Wilberforce.</i></p>

<p>"I am quite convinced that the only mode in
which the public opinion upon it here can be brought
to the state in which we wish to see it, is to keep
the question out of discussion in England by public
bodies and by the newspapers, and I must say that
it is but fair towards the King of France not to
make public in England that which he has not
published to his subjects. We shall do good in this
question in France only in proportion as we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
anticipate and carry the public opinion with us; and
in recommending to avoid discussion at present in
order to make some progress in the opinion of
France, I may lay claim to the merit of sacrificing
the popularity which I should have acquired by
having been the instrument to prevail upon the
French Government to prevent the renewal of the
trade on that part of the coast on which we had
effectually abolished it during the war. I see that
Mr. Whitbread mentioned the subject at a public
meeting in the city, which I hope will be avoided at
least till the French Government will have carried
into execution all it proposes to do at present.</p>

<p>The Duke of Wellington's letter to General
Macaulay is on the same subject: he says that in
the case of the Slave Trade he could only be successful
in France by being secret. He evidently disapproves
of the people "who will have news and
newspapers at their breakfasts," and thinks that the
great cause had suffered from prematurely published
reports.</p>


<p>

<br />
"<span class="smcap">Paris</span>, <i>December 22, 1814</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Macaulay</span>,&mdash;I received only yesterday
your letter of the 9th, and I had already received
one from Mr. Wilberforce on the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
subject, to which I have written an answer. I am
quite certain that he has nothing to say to the
publication in question.</p>

<p>"It is, I believe, very true that secrecy in such
a matter cannot be expected, but the people of
England ought to advert to this circumstance when
they are pushing their objects, and if they will
have news and newspapers at their breakfasts they
should show a little forbearance towards their
Governments, if Foreign Courts are a little close
towards their agents. In the case of the Slave
Trade I could be successful in this country only by
being secret, and in proportion as we should be
secret. And in point of fact I have found the
agents of this Government much more disposed
lately to oppose our views than they were six weeks
ago, and I have been reproached with having
allowed what has been done to be published in
our newspapers.</p>

<p>"I must observe also that though Mr. Wilberforce
could not prevent what was published from
appearing in the newspapers, Mr. Whitbread might
have avoided to mention the subject at a public
meeting held in London upon some other subject;
but the truth is that we mix up our party politics
with our philanthropy and everything else, and I
suspect we don't much care what object succeeds
or fails provided it affects the Ministers of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Matters here are apparently in the same state
as when you went away, but I believe are really
in a better state; the appointments of Monsieur

<p>Wilberforce was a member of a committee for the
relief of the "poor German sufferers," the wounded
Prussians in 1814-15. The translation of Marshal
Blucher's letter to the Managing Committee after
Waterloo is as follows.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>"Are you now satisfied? In eight days I have
fought two bloody battles, besides five considerable
engagements. I have taken one fortress, and keep
three more surrounded. Yesterday the worthy
Wellington was with me: we are agreed, we go
hand in hand: the blockaded fortresses will not
stop our operations, and if the Austrians and
Russians do not speedily push forward, we shall
finish the game ourselves. Farewell, and remember
me to all England.</p>

<p>"It is all very well, but I have twenty-two thousand
killed and wounded. It is one consolation
that they fell in the cause of humanity. I hope in
England care will be taken of our suffering brethren;
put it to the feelings of Mr. Wilberforce and other
friends."</p>

<p>In a later letter to Wilberforce, Marshal Blucher
disclaims the idea that personal affection for himself
had had anything to do with the unexampled
liberality of the English to his suffering fellow
countrymen. For this liberality he begs to be
allowed to offer other motives. 1. The flattering
description by the Duke of Wellington of the conduct
of the Prussians at the Battle of Waterloo;
2. The command of the Prince Regent to make
collections for them in all the churches of Great
Britain; and 3. Wilberforce's "own noble exertions
in their behalf." He entreats Wilberforce
to be the organ of his gratitude to the whole

<i>Marshal Blucher to Mr. Wilberforce.</i><br />
"<span class="smcap">Bonn</span>, <i>December 7, 1815</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Your letter dated the 31st of October,
reached me in safety, and with it the cheering intelligence
that the English nation, and all the
subscribers for the relief of the Prussians who have
suffered in the present war, and for the survivors
of those who have fallen, have borne an honourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
testimony to their lively interest in the cause, by
the greatest and most unexampled liberality.</p>

<p>"In your letter, sir, you are so good as to say,
that it is in some measure owing to the personal
affection felt for me by your countrymen, that this
liberality has exceeded any which in similar circumstances
has ever been exhibited; and you
appeal to my own experience in the support of
this assertion. It is true that during my residence
in England I met everywhere with the most flattering
reception; and I hope I shall always remember
it with gratitude. But this very recollection confirms
my belief, that the imagination of my services
was magnified by that affectionate goodwill which
is always the result of personal intercourse. I
cannot otherwise account for the attentions which
I received.</p>

<p>"But, sir, allow me to say that other motives
than those of personal goodwill to me have quickened
the exertions of the British nation for the
relief of the suffering Prussians. I allude to the
flattering description of their conduct at the battle
of Waterloo, by the most noble the Duke of Wellington,
and to the command of His Royal Highness
the Prince Regent, to make collections for them in
all the churches of Great Britain; neither let me
forget to mention as a most powerful cause your
own noble exertions in their behalf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>"Allow me, sir, to present you my most cordial
thanks for this fresh service which you have
rendered to suffering humanity. Let me also entreat
you, my truly noble friend, you, who so richly
deserve the blessings of the whole human race, for
having so courageously defended their rights, to be
the organ of my gratitude, and to present my acknowledgments
to the whole English nation for
their very generous assistance to my brave companions
in arms, and to the survivors of those who
have fallen. May this liberality, which we cannot
but receive as an undoubted proof of the truest
friendship and esteem, prove a fresh bond of union
between us. We fought for the highest blessings
which human nature is capable of enjoying&mdash;for
Liberality and Peace. May our high-spirited
people be firmly united in so noble a confederacy,
and may that union never be interrupted.</p>

<p>"Much as, at my advanced age, I cannot but
feel the necessity of repose, still should it please
Providence to prolong my life, I shall yet hope
once more to revisit England, and to repeat my
thanks for the sympathy of that generous nation.</p>

<p>"I entreat you to accept the assurances of my
sincere esteem and high consideration; and I have
the honour to remain, sir, your most devoted
servant,</p>

<p>Lord Holland,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> described as "truly fascinating,
having something of his uncle's good humour," by
Wilberforce, writes of Abolition to him in 1815,
and thinks "the cause had been very coldly supported,
if not actually betrayed, at Paris, at
Madrid, and at Rio Janeiro; and that we ought
to have imposed conditions on this subject when
Ferdinand VII. wanted money, instead of giving
him the money first."</p>

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I heard that you were anxious
to get some paper on the Slave Trade translated
into Italian. An Italian gentleman who is upon
a visit to me will, I am sure, very willingly undertake
it, and is well qualified for the task, as he
writes his language with great elegance and
understands ours. I am afraid you will not find
his Holiness as much disposed to anathematise
rapine and murder committed under the sanction
of the powerful Crown of Spain, as to disdain
the extravagances of the Catholicks in Ireland.
There was no difficulty in abolishing the French
Slave Trade last year but in the breasts of the
Bourbons and their adherents. Bonaparte by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
doing it at once lost no adherents either in
France or in the colonies, and the repugnance
felt in 1814 to the measure <i>at Court</i> originated
from their persuasion that the principles of all
Abolitionists, as well as of all toleration in religion,
are more or less connected with notions of political
liberty which they know to be incompatible with
their system of Government. True French Royalists,
and many English Royalists too, make no
difference between you and me or between me and
Tom Paine. We are all equally heretics in
Religion and Jacobins in Politics. There is therefore
nothing to be done with that class of men
in the great cause of Abolition, but by fear. We
have already lost many opportunities, and if we
do not now insist on Portugal and Spain abandoning
the trade, and on France and the other powers
treating it as piracy if they do not, we shall have
shifted the ignominy from ourselves, but we shall
not have rescued the world from the evil. May
I ask if you understand why the complete abolition
in France (if that measure of Bonaparte be really
and in proper form confirmed) does not make part
of the treaty? It seems to me that at Paris, at
Madrid, and at Rio Janeiro the cause has been
very coldly, or at least very inefficiently, supported,
if it has not been actually betrayed. When Ferdinand
VII. wanted money we might have imposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
conditions on this and on other subjects, but we
gave the money first, and he now sets us at
defiance. With many apologies for the length
of my letter,</p>

<p>Early in 1825, William Wilberforce's brilliant
Parliamentary career came to an end by his own
voluntary retirement. The Speaker's<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> letter is the
expression of a very general feeling both in the

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;With respect to your quitting
us for more private retirement, permit me to say
with the truest sincerity, and in accordance I am
persuaded with the unanimous sentiment of the
whole House, that we shall feel we have lost one
of our brightest ornaments, and whatever may be
the honest variance of opinion on political questions,
I know we must all be of one mind in regretting
the absence of one as distinguished for every
moral virtue as for the brilliancy of his talents.</p>

<p>"That retirement into more private life may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
contribute largely to your personal ease, and to

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I was very much gratified at
receiving your letter, not only for the kind sentiments
personally expressed towards me, but still
more for the high testimony of your authority in
favour of the course I have been pursuing. The
resolutions I lately moved were directed against
the very practice of which you complain in your
letter; only instead of an election committee I
propose a separate public committee for the purpose.
The expenses of an election committee are such
as to deter any from seeking that remedy but a
candidate who has hopes of acquiring the seat
himself, and the public is wronged for want of
some one bound over to prosecute these offences.</p>

<p>"After all, we must trust more to the frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
canvassing of the question, and the improvement
of moral feeling, which may be expected from
education, than to the letter of any law that we
can frame.</p>

<p>"I showed your letter to Mr. Pitt and Mr.

on the usefulness of your past life,</p>

</p>


<p>Wilberforce writes on the same subject in
October, 1831, to an old friend:&mdash;</p>


<p>"I cannot but think the Lords managed it
very ill not to attempt the discovery of some
compromise, giving up the rotten boroughs, granting
members to great towns, accepting the new
county members, and yet somewhat raising the
qualification (surely no pauper should have the
right of voting); this must at least have prevented
the common fraud now practised on the people,
that of imputing to those who voted at all against
the Bill that they wished to retain all the worst
abuses, which, in fact, they were as willing as the
reformers to abolish. But I must break off. You,
and I hope I, are prompted to say with old
Hooker, I have lived long enough to see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
the world is made up of perturbations. But, blessed
be God, there remaineth a rest for the people of
God. May I be permitted to meet you there, my
dear sir."</p>

<p>On the different effects of the Oxford and
Cambridge system on the minds of young men,
Wilberforce writes to a friend:&mdash;</p>


<p>
<i>Mr. Wilberforce to Mr. William Gray.</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"<i>December 31</i>, 1830.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"It is curious to observe the effects of the
Oxford system in producing on the minds of
young men a strong propensity to what may be
termed Tory principles. From myself and the
general tenour of our family and social circle, it
might have been supposed that my children,
though averse to party, would be inclined to
adopt Liberal or, so far as would be consistent
with party, Whig principles, but all my three
Oxonians are strong friends to High Church and
King doctrines. The effects I myself have witnessed
would certainly induce me, had I to decide
on the University to which any young protegé
of mine should go, were he by natural temper or
any other causes too prone to excess on the Tory
side, I should decidedly send him to Cambridge,
Trinity; were the opposite the case he should
be fixed at Oriel, Oxford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>"As for the gentleman you mention,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> his character
is not to be expressed in a few words. Of his
extraordinary powers no one ever entertained a
doubt. There are also very pleasing traits of
private character: I have been assured of his incessant
and kind attentions to his old mother. On
his brother's failing, I believe, in business, he paid
his debts to a large amount and took on himself,
I am assured, before being in office, the charge
of his eight or nine children. Of his own little
girl he was excessively fond, and he was always
kind in what concerned friends or acquaintances.
I cannot also but hope that he has seen so much
of religious men as almost to have superior confidence
in them. But you suppose me to be more
personally acquainted with him than I am."</p>

<p>The next letter, to Mr. Manning, contains an
allusion to his son Henry, afterwards Cardinal
Manning, of whom it will be noted that Wilberforce
"forms sanguine hopes that he will be a
blessing to his fellow creatures."</p>

<p>At the time the letter was written, Wilberforce's
large fortune had been seriously diminished, though
he was far from being, as his letter would lead one
to suppose, in the same unfortunate position as
Mr. Manning.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The effect of his own loss was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
as he says, "greatly to augment his happiness."
Enough was left for his comfort. It is true he gave
up his home, and was no longer able to practise
indiscriminate hospitality; also his subscriptions
had to be curtailed, such as those to the York
charities, as to which he "had been reminded in
1831 that they were larger than those of any other
subscriber."</p>


<p>
<i>Mr. Wilberforce to Mr. Manning.<br />
"June 11, 1832.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"I am truly rejoiced, my dear friend, to hear
that you are so comfortably circumstanced. I
also have abundant cause for thankfulness. The
loss of fortune was graciously delayed in my
instance until all my children having been educated,
and two of them supplied with comfortable residences
(Robert, my second son, recently by the
perfectly spontaneous kindness of Lord Brougham),
so that the effect of my loss of fortune has been
greatly to augment Mrs. W.'s and my own happiness.
What can be more delightful than to be
the daily witness of our children having a large
measure of conjugal happiness, the best of this
world's goods, while at the same time they are
discharging conscientiously and zealously the important
duties of the pastoral office. It gave me
real pleasure that your son had given up the
situation at the Treasury for the Church. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
heard such an account of him from my sons, as
gives me reason to form sanguine hopes that he
will be a blessing to his fellow creatures."</p>

well-known picture of Wilberforce now in the
National Portrait Gallery.</p>

<p>"You make a too flattering apology for sending

assured, my dear sir, that by those the nearest
to me it will be equally prized when the person
to whom it is written can no longer produce it

<p class="big center">HOME LETTERS.</p>


<p>The family letters which follow are some of a
religious character, while others turn on more
general topics.</p>

<p>Four letters written by Wilberforce to his
daughter Elizabeth, aged fifteen at the date the
correspondence begins, show the care with which
he instilled into her mind all that he considered
of most moment; also how he exercised "the
privilege of a friend," for such he considered himself
to his daughter, and "told her frankly all
her faults."</p>


<p>
<i>Mr. Wilberforce to his daughter Elizabeth.<br />
"November 30, 1816.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"This is but a short letter to my dear Elizabeth.
When I do address my dear girl, I ought to consider
how I can best testify my friendship: for
friendship let there be between us; never can you
have a friend more warmly attached to you or
more interested in your welldoing and happiness
than myself. But if we are to be friends, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
must allow me the privilege of a friend, a privilege
by far the most valuable of all its excellencies.
So thought your dear Uncle Stephen,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> when in the
very extreme bitterness of his grief, which was as
great as that of any one I ever witnessed, though he
is now able to control his feelings before company,
he said to me while enlarging on the various
particulars of my dear sister's extraordinary character,
'O, she was a friend to my soul! She
told me frankly all my faults,' an office in which,
I am obliged to confess, he charged me with having
been deficient. This has arisen, however, solely
from my scarcely ever having seen him alone,
when only I could converse with him confidentially.
But if I am to exercise this best prerogative, this
most sacred and indispensable duty of friendship,
it will be necessary for my dear Elizabeth to prepare
her mind and temper for receiving it properly,
and for deriving from it all the benefits it is capable
of imparting. Shall I be honest, and I must be
so or be silent; were I otherwise, the very sheet
which I am writing would rise up in judgment
against me at the last day; if then, I am frank
and honest, I must declare to you, that it is on
this quarter that it will be necessary for my dear
girl to guard herself with the utmost watchfulness,
and, still more, to <i>prepare herself</i> with conscientious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
care. This is what St. Paul terms "exercising
herself to maintain a conscience void of offence
towards God and towards man": what the Book
of Proverbs styles, "keeping the heart <i>with all
diligence</i>:" for unless we have accustomed ourselves
to <i>self-suspicion</i>, if I may use such a phrase, we
never benefit as we might from the friendly
reproofs of a real friend. We may receive
his remarks with civility, and even give him
credit for his kind intentions, but we shall be
almost sure to let it appear to any acute
observer at least, that we rather tolerate his frankness
out of principle, or put up with it in consideration
of the friendly motives by which it has
been prompted, than that we listen to it with a
sincere desire of profiting from it, still less that
we welcome it as one of the most valuable services
in design, even when not in fact, that could be
rendered to us. The grand preparation that is
needed is, Humility: that sense of our own infirmities
and our own weakness, which is felt by
every true, at least by every flourishing Christian.
We read in the Scripture that 'our hearts are
deceitful above all things:' by which is meant,
that we are all prone to flatter ourselves, to form
too high an estimate of our own good qualities,
and too low an idea of our bad ones. Now it is
the first office of the Holy Spirit to teach us to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
know ourselves, and immediately to <i>suspect</i> ourselves
as the first effect of that knowledge. Now
be honest with yourself, my very dear child.
Have you been accustomed to distrust the judgment
you have been in the habit of forming of
your own character, as you would have done if it
had been formed and stated to you by any one
whom you knew to be a notorious liar? Yet this
is really the way in which we ought to feel; I
know how difficult it is in practice from my own
experience; and because it is so difficult, it is
here that we need the special aid of the Holy
Spirit, and should earnestly pray for His blessed
influence to teach us to know ourselves. Be
earnest, then, in prayer, my very dear Elizabeth, and
frequent in self-examination on this very point.
I have often detected my own self-partiality and
self-deceit by observing how differently the same
fault, be it small or great, appears to me when
committed by myself, and when committed by
others, how much more ready I am with apologies
for it, or with extenuations for its guilt. If a
servant has done anything wrong, or omitted
some act of duty, I observe <i>how</i> it appears to me,
and if I have done much the same fault, or been
guilty of the same omission, how much less does it
impress itself on me, how much sooner do I forget
it. I assure you, I speak sincerely when I tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
you I find this the case with myself: now observe
whether you do; and if so, then it will be a subject
for humiliation before God, and a motive for
earnest prayer. Let my dearest Lizzie be particularly
watchful to improve the present season;
for as you have heard me say, Christ&mdash;as is
stated in Rev. iii.&mdash;'stands at the door and knocks,'
that is, He uses particular events and circumstances
of our lives, for impressing us with the importance
of spiritual things, and if the event and
the circumstances pass over without producing
their proper effect, there is always a positive bad
consequence. So much grace is, as it were
expended on us in vain. The heart becomes
harder and less favourably disposed on another
occasion. And though we must not limit the
grace and power of God, yet it is a great point
to know what the Scripture (2 Cor. vi.) terms
"our appointed time, our day of salvation." I
am sure you find your heart softened and affected
more than usual just now. O try, my beloved
girl, to render this permanently, let me say eternally,
useful to you. I understand you are reading
Doddridge's 'Rise and Progress.' You cannot
read a better book. I hope it was one of the means
of turning my heart to God. Certainly, there
are few books which have been so extensively
useful. Pray over some of the prayers at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
conclusion of the chapters; as, for instance, if I
remember right, that at the end of the chapter,
'After a state of spiritual decay.' But I have
not the book at hand, and cannot quote it from
memory. Don't read this till you have half an
hour's leisure."</p>

<p>Of the privilege of friendship alluded to in this
letter, Wilberforce also writes later to his daughter
Elizabeth: "You will never find telling Robert" (afterwards
Archdeacon Wilberforce), "of any fault offend
him, if you do it when you are <i>tête à tête</i>, and when he
sees from your manner and from the circumstances
that you can only have his happiness at heart, I
mean that this friendly regard can alone prompt
you to such a proof of real attachment."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dearest Lizzy</span>,&mdash;Your letter to-day gives
me pleasure. We heard from Marianne (Thornton)
of her having paid you a visit. Her friendly attachment
to Barbara<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and you, I account as one of the
special blessings of Providence; and there are many
particulars, though not all, in which I should be
very glad to have her the object of your imitation.
I am half asleep from not having had a good night,
and find myself occasionally writing one word instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
of another&mdash;a slip which I sometimes witness
in my dear Lizzy's case; I know not whether it be
from the same cause, I hope not. For my last
night's wakefulness arose in part from my thinking
on some subjects of deep interest from which, though
I made several efforts, I could not altogether withdraw
my thoughts. My mind obeyed me indeed
while I continued wide awake, but when dropping
half asleep, it started aside from the serious and
composing train of ideas to which I had forced it
up, and like a swerving horse, it chose to go its own
way rather than mine. It is a delightful consideration,
my dearest child, that there is a gracious and
tender Saviour who, in our sleeping as well as
waking hours, is watching over us for good, if we
are of the number of those who look to Him
habitually for consolation and peace, and such I
trust will be more and more the case of my dear
Elizabeth."</p>

<p>The next letter is in a more lively strain and
explains to Elizabeth the system of Bishop Berkeley.</p>


<p>
<i>Mr. Wilberforce to his daughter Elizabeth.</i><br />

</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Lizzy</span>,&mdash;If many intentions to write
could be admitted as making up one letter, you
would have to thank me for being so good a correspondent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
But I fear that this is a mode of calculation
that will only come into use, when the system
of good Bishop Berkeley has become established.
I cannot explain what this is so well as Robert
could, but its distinctive principle is that there are
no such things as substances. You may suppose
that you have had the pleasure of re-visiting a very
dear friend, called Miss Palmer, and you probably
would assure me, if I asked you whether they still
continued at the Hall any such vulgar practice as
that of eating, that the turkies and fowls were as
good and as freely bestowed as when I used to partake
of them in earlier years. All mere delusion.
All imagination. All ideal. There is no Elizabeth
(she only <i>appeared</i> to occupy an ideal place in an
ideal carriage, when she travelled down to Mosely
and Elmdon), there is no Miss Palmer, nor are the
fowls and turkies a whit more substantial than the
supposed eaters of them, I really am serious&mdash;such
is the system of one of the ablest and best of
men (he was spoken of by Pope as 'Having every
virtue under heaven'); he held that the Almighty
formed us so as to have impressions produced on
us as if these were realities, but that this was all.
I little intended when I took up my pen to give you
such a Lecture in Metaphysics. I am sure I have
had a Lecture, a practical one, on the duty of bearing
interruptions with good humour. This morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
(it is now 4 p.m. and dinner taking on the
table) I took up my pen at 10 o'clock, and my first
thoughts were naturally drawn to you. Scarcely had
I finished my first sentence when in came Knowles
(as queer he is as ever) and announced Lord Teignmouth.
Up I went to him in the drawing-room,
and as cordial a shake of the hand he received from
me as one friend can give to another. But I own I
began to wish I could be in two places at once. I
had secured as I thought, several hours of quiet,
and my eyes happened to be better than for sometime
past, and I was therefore hoping to pay away
a great part of my epistolary arrears, when in comes
my friend, and remains with me between three and
four hours, refusing to stay dinner, but not departing
till after the post had gone out. However, such
incidents are salutary, they accustom us to bear with
cheerfulness the little vexatious interruptions which
people sometimes bear with less equanimity than
more serious grievances. Here enter Uncle
Stephen&mdash;&mdash;But with some pressing I have got him
to agree to stay till to-morrow morning, so I may
finish my letter. I must first tell you what I think
a remarkably well-expressed description of Lady
Raffles, contained in a letter from the Duchesse de
Broglie, to whom I gave Lady R. a letter of
introduction&mdash;'C'est une personne qui inspire un
profond interêt. Elle a tant de dignité et de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
douceur.' The epithets appear to me very happy.
And now, my dear Lizzy, I must conclude my very
disjointed letter, written <i>à plusiers reprises</i> as the
French phrase it."</p>

<p>Elizabeth would seem to have written to her
father as to her solitariness of spirit in so confidential
a strain that his sympathy had been
thoroughly awakened. In his answer he excuses himself
for not having been more of a companion to her
on the ground that he had been so long engaged in
public business, and also that as he had been almost
an old bachelor before he married, he had got out
of the habit of tender attention to young women of
education and delicacy; but he assures her she will
always find in him unfeigned tenderness of spirit
for all her feelings, and all her infirmities. His
remedies for "solitariness of spirit" are most
practical.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Very Dear Lizzy</span>,&mdash;Though, owing to my
having been betrayed into forgetfulness of the
flight of time while sitting under the shade of the
lime tree it is now so late that I shall not be able to
write to you so fully as I wished and intended, I
must not be so unjust to myself or so unkind to you
as I certainly should be if I were not to reply to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
your last interesting letter as soon as possible.
And yet, my dear girl, it could be only from nervous
sensibility that you could doubt of my putting the
right construction on your opening your heart to me
without disguise. I wish you could have seen the
whole interior of mine when I had read through it:
I am not ashamed to say that I melted into tears of
affectionate sympathy. Your letter really contained
nothing but what tended to call forth feelings of
esteem and regard for you. My dear Lizzy, I will
return your openness by a similar display of it. I
will confess to you that I have not seldom blamed
myself for not endeavouring more to cheer your
solitary hours, when you have had no friend of your
own sex to whom you could open your heart, and I
will try to amend of this fault. My not walking
with you more frequently has, however, been often
caused by the circumstance you mention, that at the
very hour at which I can get out, just when the
post has departed, you are yourself employed in a
way of which I always think with pleasure, and
which I doubt not will bring down a blessing on
your head. But there is another cause which may
have some effect in rendering me less tenderly
attentive than young women of education and
delicacy like persons to be, and must in some
measure find them, before they can open their
hearts to them with unreserved freedom. I allude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
to my having been so long and so constantly engaged
in public business and having been almost an
old bachelor before I married. Let my dear child,
however, be assured that she will always experience
from me an unfeigned tenderness of spirit and a
kind consideration for all her feelings and even, shall
I say it, all her infirmities. Meanwhile let me advise
you, my dear child, whenever you do feel anything
of that solitariness of spirit of which you speak, to
endeavour to find an antidote for it in prayer.
There is often much of bodily nervousness in it. I
am ashamed to acknowledge that I am sometimes
conscious of it myself. Another method which I
would recommend to you for getting the better of
it, is to engage in some active exertion, teaching
some child, instructing some servant, comforting
some poor sufferer from poverty and sickness. I
deeply feel the Bishop and Mrs. Ryder's kindness
to you, but it is of a piece with all their conduct
towards me and mine. God bless them, I say
from the heart."</p>

pains to prove to me that you are nine not in years
only, but in head and heart and mind. Above all,
my dearest Samuel, I am anxious to see decisive
marks of your having begun to undergo the <i>great
change</i>. I come again and again to look to see if
it really be begun, just as a gardener walks up
again and again to examine his fruit trees and see
if his peaches are set; if they are swelling and
becoming larger, finally if they are becoming ripe
and rosy. I would willingly walk barefoot from
this place to Sandgate to see a clear proof of the

guard as you would against a wild beast which was
lying in a bush by which you were to pass, ready
to spring upon you&mdash;guard in like manner, I say,

it might seem strange to some thoughtless people
that I am glad to hear you are unhappy. But as
it is about your soul, and as I know that a short
unhappiness of this kind often leads to lasting
happiness and peace and joy, I cannot but rejoice.
I trust, my dear boy, it is the Spirit of God knocking
at the door of your heart, as the Scripture
expresses it, and making you feel uneasy, that you
may be driven to find pardon and the sanctifying
influences of the Holy Spirit, and so be made one
of Christ's flock and be taken care of in this world
and be delivered from hell, and be taken when you
die, whether sooner or later, to everlasting happiness
in heaven. My dearest boy, whenever you
feel in this way, I beseech you, get alone and fall
on your knees, and pray as earnestly as you can to
God for Christ's sake to forgive you and to sanctify
you, and in short to make you to be born again, as
our Saviour expressed it to Nicodemus."</p>

little better than an epitome. Let me tell you I
was pleased with your skeleton of Mr. Langston's
sermon, and I should be glad of such another bag
of bones. My dear boy, whenever you feel any
meltings of mind, any sorrow for sin, or any concern
about your soul, do not, I beg of you, stifle it or

I fear you do not apply to your business with
energy. This, remember, was your fault at Mr.

that this arose in a great degree from your wanting
spirits, in consequence of your having no play-fellows

others should discover, yet if we soon recover our
good-humour, and treat with kindness the person

It may help us to do this to reflect that such
persons are rendering us, even when they themselves
may not mean it, but may even only be
gratifying their own dislike of us, the greatest
almost of all services, perhaps may be helping us
to obtain an eternal increase of our happiness and

blood of Christ, altogether freely and of mere undeserved
mercy, yet when once reconciled, and

very honest with you. When I heard that the
cost was to be half a guinea, I greatly doubted
whether it would be warrantable to pay such a
sum for such a performance for such <i>youth</i>. This
last consideration has considerable weight with me,
both as it renders the pleasure of the entertainment
less, and as at your early age the sources of
pleasure are so numerous. But my difficulties were
all removed by finding that the money would not
merely be applied to the use of tweedledum and
tweedledee (though I write this, no one is fonder

scenes through which he is passing, and to be
cheered by the consciousness that he is now
carrying forward all the necessary agricultural processes

abundant harvest. Use yourself, dear boy, to take
time occasionally for reflection. Let this be done

<p>"Did you ever cross a river with a horse in a
ferry boat? If so, you must have observed, if
you are an observing creature, which if you are
not I beg you will become with all possible celerity,
that the said horse is perfectly quiet after he is
once fairly in the boat&mdash;a line of conduct in which
it would be well if this four-footed navigator were
imitated by some young bipeds I have known in
their aquatic exercitations. And so said animal
continues&mdash;the quadruped I mean, mind&mdash;perfectly
quiet until he begins to approach the opposite
shore. Then he begins to show manifest signs of
impatience by dancing and frisking sometimes to
such a degree as to overset the boat, to the no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
small injury of others (for whom he very little
cares) as well as himself. This is what may be
well called making more haste than good speed.
None the less, though I am fully aware that the
same frisking quadruped is a very improper subject
of imitation, not only to an old biped but to an
experienced M.P. of forty years' standing, yet I
find myself in a state of mind exactly like that of
the horse above mentioned, though it has not the
same effects on my animal powers, and though,
being on dry land and in a parlour, not a boat, I
might frisk away if I chose with perfect impunity
to myself and others. But to quit metaphor which
I have fairly worn out, or, rather, rode to death,
when I was a hundred miles from my dear Samuel,
though my affection for him was as strong and my
sentiments and feelings as much employed in him
as now, yet these are now accompanied with an
impatient longing to extinguish the comparatively
little distance that is between us, and to have
my dearest boy not only in my heart but in my
arms, and yet on reflection this very feeling is
beneficial. I recollect that our separation is an
act of self-denial, and I offer it up to my Saviour
with a humble sense of His goodness, in subjecting
me to such few and those comparatively such easy
crosses. My dearest Samuel will remember to
have our blessed Lord continually in remembrance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>

your examination is, or part of it at least, disadvantageous
to you. Does not this arise in part
from your having stayed with us when your school-fellows
were at Maisemore? If so, the lesson is
one which, if my dear boy duly digests it and
bottles it up for future use, may be a most valuable
one for the rest of his life. It illustrates a remark
which I well remember in Bishop Butler's 'Analogy,'
that our faults often bring on some bad consequence
long after they have been committed, and
when they perhaps have been entirely banished
from our memory. Some self-indulgence perhaps
may have lost us an advantage, the benefit of
which might have extended through life. But it
is due to my dear Samuel to remark that, though
his stay was protracted a very little out of self-indulgence
(as much ours as his), yet it was chiefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
occasioned by the necessity of his going up to
London on account of his ancle. (By the way,
tell me in two words&mdash;ancle better or worse or
<i>idem.</i>) But my Samuel must not vex himself
with the idea of falling below the boy who has
commonly been his competitor, owing to his stay
having prevented his reading what is to be in
part the subject of the examination. It would
really be quite wrong to feel much on this account,
and that for several reasons. First, everybody
about you will know the disadvantages under
which you start, and will make allowances accordingly.
Next, if you do as well or better in the
parts you <i>have</i> read, you will show the probability
of your having done well in the other also, if you
had possessed with it the same advantage. And
what I wish my dearest boy seriously to consider
is, that any uneasiness he might feel on account of
this circumstance would deserve no better a name
than emulation, which the apostle enumerates as
one of the lusts of the flesh. You should do your
business and try to excel in it, to please your
Saviour, as a small return for all He has done for
you, but a return which He will by no means
despise. It is this which constitutes the character
of a real Christian: that, considering himself as
bought with a price&mdash;viz., that of the blood of
Jesus Christ&mdash;he regards it as his duty to try and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
please his Saviour in everything. And to be
honest with you, my very dear boy, let me tell
you that it appears to me very probable that the
Heavenly Shepherd, whose tender care of His
people is, you must remember, described to us
as like that of a shepherd towards the tender lambs
of his flock, may have designed by this very incident
to discover to you that you were too much under
the influence of emulation, and to impress you
with a sense of the duty of rooting it out. Emulation
has a great tendency to lessen love. It is
scarcely possible to have a fellow-feeling (that is,
duly to sympathise) with anyone if we are thinking
much about, and setting our hearts on, getting
before him, or his not getting before us. This
disposition of mind, which includes in it an over-estimation
of the praise of our fellow-creatures, is
perhaps the most subtle and powerful of all our
corruptions, and that which costs a real Christian
the most trouble and pain; for he will never be
satisfied in his mind unless the chief motive in
his mind and feelings is the way to please his
Saviour. The best way to promote the right
temper of mind will be after earnest prayer to
God to bless your endeavours, to try to keep the
idea of Jesus Christ and of His sufferings, and of
the love which prompted Him willingly to undergo
them, in your mind continually, and especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
when you are going to do, occasionally when you
are doing, your business. And then recollect that
He has declared He will kindly accept as a tribute
of gratitude whatever we do to please Him, and
call to mind all His kindness, all His sacrifices;
what glory and happiness He left, what humiliation
and shame and agony He endured; and then reflect
that the only return He, who is then, remember, at
that very moment actually looking upon you, expects
from you, is that you should remember His
Heavenly Father who sent Him, and Him Himself,
and (as I said before) endeavour to please Him.
This He tells us is to be done by keeping God's
commandments. And my dear Samuel knows
that this obedience must be universal&mdash;all God's
commandments. Not that we shall be able actually
to do this; but then we must wish and desire to
do it. And when, from our natural corruption,
infirmities do break out we must sincerely lament
them, and try to guard against them in future.
Thus a true Christian endeavours to have the
idea of his Saviour continually present with him.
To do his business as the Scripture phrases it,
unto the Lord and not unto men. To enjoy his
gratifications as allowed to him by his merciful and
kind Saviour, who knows that we need recreations,
and when they are neither wrong in kind nor
excessive in degree they may and should be enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
with a grateful recollection of Him who
intends for us still nobler and higher pleasures
hereafter. This is the very perfection of religion;
'Whether we eat or drink or whatever we do, do
all to the glory of God.'</p>

<p>"All I am now contending for is that my dearest
Samuel may at least endeavour to do his school
business with a recollection of his Saviour, and a
wish to please Him, and when he finds the feeling
of emulation taking the place of this right principle
look up and beg God's pardon for it, and implore
the Holy Spirit's help to enable you to feel as you
ought and wish to feel. But let me also ask my
dear Samuel to reflect if he did not stay too long
at home in the last holidays. Too much prosperity
and self-indulgence (and staying at home may be
said to be a young person's indulgence and prosperity)
are good neither for man nor boy, neither
for you nor for myself."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My very dear Boy</span>,&mdash;I congratulate you cordially
on your success, and I rejoice to hear of
your literary progress. But I should have been
still more gratified, indeed beyond all comparison
more, had Mr. Hodson's certificate of your scholarship
been accompanied, as it formerly was, with
an assurance that you were advancing in the
still more important particulars of self-control, of
humility, of love&mdash;in short, in all the various forms
and phases, if I may so term them, which St.
Paul ascribes to it in his beautiful eulogium (1 Cor.
xiii.). Oh, my dear boy, I should be even an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
unnatural father instead of what I trust I am, an
affectionate one, if, believing as I do, and bearing
in mind that you are an immortal being who must
be happy or miserable for ever, I were not, above
all things, anxious to see you manifest those buds
and shoots which alone are true indications of a
celestial plant, the fruits of which are the produce
of the Garden of God. My dear Samuel, be honest
with yourself; you have enjoyed and still enjoy
many advantages for which you are responsible.
Use them <i>honestly</i>; that is, according to their just
intention and fair employment and improvement.
Above all things, my dearest boy, cultivate a
spirit of prayer. Never hurry over your devotions,
still less omit them. Farewell, my dearest boy."</p>

<p>"In speaking of the pros and cons of Maisemore,
you spoke of one great boy with whom you disagreed.
I always meant to ask you about the
nature, causes, and extent of your difference. And
the very idea of a standing feud is so opposite to
the Christian character that I can scarcely understand
it. I can, however, conceive a youth of such
crabbed and wayward temper that the only way of
going on with him is that of avoiding all intercourse
with him as much as possible. But, nine times out
of ten, if one of two parties be really intent on
healing the breach and preventing the renewal of it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
the thing may be done. Now, my dear Samuel,
may not you be partly in fault? If so, I beg of you
to strive to get the better of it. I have recently
had occasion to observe how much a frank and kind
demeanour, when we conceive we have really just
cause for complaint, disarms resentment and conciliates
regard. Remember, my dearest boy, that
you have enjoyed advantages which probably R. has
not, and that therefore more Christian kindness and
patience may be expected from you than from him.
Again, you would be glad, I am sure, to produce in
his mind an opinion favourable to true religion, and
not that he should say, 'I don't see what effect
Christianity has produced in Samuel Wilberforce.'
Oh, my dear Samuel, I love you most affectionately,
and I wish you could see how earnestly I long hereafter
(perhaps from the world of spirits) to witness
my dearest boy's progress into professional life that
of a growing Christian, 'shining more and more
into the perfect day.' My Samuel's conduct as it
respects his studies, and, what I value much more,
his disposition and behaviour, has been such
for some time as to draw on him Mr. Hodson's
eulogium, and so I trust he will continue doing."</p>

continue to have such reports of my dear Samuel
wherever he may be. They quite warm his old

<p>"You never can have a friend, your dear
affectionate mother alone excepted, whose interests
and sympathies are so identically the same. Yet I
have known instances in which, though children
have been convinced in their understandings of this
being the case between them and their parents, yet
from not having begun at an early period of life to
make a father a confidant, they could not bring
themselves to do it when they grew older, but felt a
strange shrinking back from opening their minds to
the parent they cordially loved, and of whose love
to them they were fully satisfied. I hope you will
continue, my dear Samuel, to speak to me without
constraint or concealment.</p>

<p>"The two chief questions you ask relate to
Repentance and to Predestination. As to the
former&mdash;sorrow for sin is certainly a part of it,
but the degree of the feelings of different people
will be as different as their various tempers and
dispositions. If the same person whose feelings
were very tender and susceptible on other topics
and occasions were very cold in religion, that
doubtless of itself is no good sign. But remember,
repentance in the Greek means a change of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
heart, and the test of its sincerity is more its
rendering us serious and watchful in our endeavours
to abstain from sin and to practise known duty,
than its causing many tears to flow, which effect
may be produced in a susceptible nature with very
little solid impression on the heart and character.
The grand mark, I repeat it, of true repentance, is
its providing a dread of sin and a watchfulness
against it. As for Predestination, the subject is one
the depths of which no human intellect can fathom.
But even the most decided Predestinarians I have
ever known have acknowledged that the invitations
of God were made to all without exception, and
that it was men's own fault that they did not accept
these invitations. Again, does it not appear undeniably
from one end of Scripture to the other that
men's perishing, where they do perish, is always
represented as their own bringing on? Indeed the
passage in Ezekiel, 'As I live, saith the Lord, I
have no pleasure in the death of a sinner, but that
he should repent and live.' Again, do compare the
ninth of Romans, in which that awful passage is
contained: 'Hath not the potter power over the
clay to make one vessel to honour, and another to
dishonour? What if God,' &amp;c., &amp;c.; and compare
this with Jeremiah, I think xviiith, to which passage
St. Paul manifestly refers, and you will see there
that the executing or remitting a threatening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
of vengeance is made to depend on the object
of the threats turning from his evil way or
continuing in it. This is very remarkable. Only
pray, my dearest boy, and all will be well; and strive
not to grieve the Holy Spirit. Before you actually
engage in prayer always pause a minute or two and
recollect yourself, and especially practise my rule of
endeavouring to imagine myself in the presence of
God, and to remember that to God all the bad
actions, bad tempers, bad words of my whole life
are all open in their entire freshness of circumstances
and colouring; and when I recollect how I
felt on the first committing of a wrong action, and
then call to mind that to God sin must appear in
itself far more hateful than to me, this reflection I
often find to produce in me a deep humiliation; and
then the promise is sure&mdash;the Lord is nigh to them
that are of a contrite heart, and will save such as be
of a humble spirit. I rejoice that it has pleased
God to touch your heart. May I live, if it please
God, to see you an honour to your family and a
blessing to your fellow-creatures."</p>

day will come when my dear Samuel will in his

<p>"The train of your idea and feelings is precisely
that which I believe is commonly experienced at
the outset of a religious course. It was my own, I
am sure; I mean specially that painful apprehension
of which you speak, lest your sorrow for sin should
be less on account of its guilt than its danger, less
on account of its hatefulness in the sight of God, and
its ingratitude towards your Redeemer, than on that
of its subjecting you to the wrath and punishment
of God. But, my dear Samuel, blessed be God, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
serve a gracious Master, a merciful Sovereign, who
has denounced those threatenings for the very
purpose of exciting our fears; and thereby being
driven to flee from the wrath to come and lay hold
on eternal life. By degrees the humble hope of
your having obtained the pardon of your sins and
the possession of the Divine favour will enable you
to look up to God with feelings of filial confidence
and love, and to Christ as to an advocate and a
friend. The more you do this the better. Use
yourself, my dearest Samuel, to take now and then
a solitary walk, and in it to indulge in these spiritual
meditations. The disposition to do this will
gradually become a habit, and a habit of unspeakable
value. I have long considered it as a great misfortune,
or rather, I should say, as having been very
injurious to your brother William, that he never
courted solitude in his walks, or indeed at any time.
Some people are too much inclined to it, I grant;
they often thereby lose the inestimable benefit
which results from having a friend to whom we
open our hearts, one of the most valuable of all
possessions both for this world and the next.
When I was led into speaking of occasional
intervals of solitude ('when Isaac, like the solitary
saint, Walks forth to meditate at eventide,' you
remember the passage, I doubt not), I was mentioning
that holy, peaceful, childlike trust in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
fatherly love of our God and Saviour which
gradually diffuses itself through the soul and takes
possession of it, when we are habitually striving to
walk by faith under the influence of the Holy
Spirit. When we allow ourselves to slacken or be
indolent in our religious exercises, much more when
we fall into actual sin, or have not watched over
our tempers so as to be ashamed of looking our
Heavenly Father in the face (if I may so express
myself, I am sure with no irreverent meaning), then
this holy confidence lessens and its diminution is a
warning to us that we are going on ill. We must
then renew our repentance and supplications, and
endeavour to obtain a renewed supply of the blessed
influences of the divine Spirit; and then we shall
again enjoy the light of God's countenance. There
are two or three beautiful sections in Doddridge's
'Rise and Progress' on these heads, and I earnestly
recommend especially to you that, the subject of
which is, I think, the Christian under the hiding of
God's presence. I have been looking, and I find
the section, or rather chapter I allude to, is that
entitled, 'Case of spiritual decay and languor in
religion.' There is a following one on 'Case of a
relapse into known sin,' and I trust you have a
pretty good edition of this super-excellent book.</p>

<p>"I have a word to say on another topic&mdash;that, I
mean, of purity&mdash;the necessity of most scrupulous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
guarding against the very first commencement or
even against the appearance of evil is in no
instance so just and so important as in the case of
all sins of this class. Many a man who would have
been restrained from the commission of sins of this
class by motives of worldly prudence or considerations
of humanity, has been hurried into sin by not
attending to this warning. I myself remember an
instance of this kind in two people, both of whom I
knew. And as Paley truly remarks that there is no
class of vices which so depraves the character as
illicit intercourse with the female sex, so he likewise
mentions it as a striking proof of the superior
excellence of Christ's moral precepts, that in the case
of chastity and purity it lays the restraint on the
<i>heart</i> and on the <i>thoughts</i> as the only way of
providing against the grossest acts of disobedience.
Oh, my dear Samuel, guard here with especial care,
and may God protect and keep you. Indeed, I
trust He will, and it is with exceeding pleasure that
I think of you, and humbly and hopefully look
forward on your advancing course in life. I did not
intend saying half so much, but when I enter into
conversation with my Samuel I know not how to
stop. 'With thee conversing I forget all course of

business, and the chief object was to take precautions
against the disposition to waste time at breakfast

myself by the decisive test of figures that I was
not working so hard as I should have supposed

But both his hereditary, and his personal, claim to

with the Gisbornes and Evans's, and from them
with a Mr. Smith Wright and his wife, Lady Sitwell.
She is a sensible, interesting woman. They
live in a residence, Okeover, which is in the most
beautiful part of Derbyshire, very near Dovedale,
close to Ilam, &amp;c. My dear Samuel will one day, I
trust, delight himself in these beautiful and romantic
vallies. My chief object in these visits was to
provide future intimacies and I hope friendships for
you and your brothers. And how thankful ought
we to be, to be enabled thus to select for our
associates the best families in so many different
counties; best, I mean, in the true sense of the word,&mdash;men
of real worth, who, I am sure, will always
receive you with kindness for my sake. I often
look up with gratitude to the Giver of all good,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
for the favour with men&mdash;which it would be affectation
not to confess where it is not improper to
mention such things, that He has graciously given
me, chiefly in the view of its ensuring for my
children the friendly regard and personal kindnesses
of many good people after I shall be laid low in the

<p>"I could have made them acquainted with great
people, but I have always avoided it, from a

most gratifying to me to reflect that they will be
known to some of the very best people in the
kingdom, and to good people of other countries
also. Oh, my dear Samuel, how thankful should we
be to our Heavenly Father who has made our cup
to overflow with mercies. How rich will our
portion appear when compared with that of so
many of our fellow-creatures. It used, when I was
a bachelor especially, when I often spent my
Sundays alone, to be my frequent Sunday habit to
number up my blessings, and I assure you it is a
most useful practice; <i>e.g.</i>, that I had been born in
Great Britain, in such a century, such a part of it,
such a rank in life, such a class and character of
parents, then my personal privileges. But I have

<p>The next letter touches on topics of the day, and

<p>"I believe I never answered your question who it
was that advised me to retire from Parliament. I
entirely forget. Your question, Will there be war?
I answer, I know no more than you do, but I am
inclined to believe the French will attack Spain,
very unadvisedly in my opinion, and I shall be
surprised if the French Government itself, however
priding itself on its policy, will not ultimately
have reason to form the same judgment....
Never was there before a country on earth, the
public affairs of which (for many years past at
least I may affirm it,) were administered with
such a simple and strong desire to promote the
public welfare as those of Great Britain. And
it is very remarkable that some of those very
measures which were brought forward and carried
through with the most general concurrence have
subsequently appeared most doubtful. The
present extreme distress of the agricultural class
throughout the whole kingdom, is admitted by
all to have been in some degree, by many to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
have been entirely, caused by our ill-managed
if not ill-advised return to cash payments, in
which nearly the whole of both Houses concurred.
Surely this should teach us to be
diffident in our judgments of others, and to hold
our own opinions with moderation. In short, my
dear Samuel, the best preparation for being a
good politician, as well as a superior man in
every other line, is to be a truly religious man.
For this includes in it all those qualities which
fit men to pass through life with benefit to others
and with reputation to ourselves. Whatever
is to be the effect produced by the subordinate
machinery, the main-spring must be the desire
to please God, which, in a Christian, implies
faith in Christ and a grateful sense of the
mercies of God through a Redeemer, and an
aspiration after increasing holiness of heart and
life. And I am reminded (you will soon see
the connection of my ideas) of a passage in a
former letter of yours about a home, and I do
not deny that your remarks were very natural.
Yet every human situation has its advantages as
well as its evils. And if the want of a home
deprive us of the many and great pleasures
which arise out of the relations and associations,
especially in the case of a large family, with
which it is connected, yet there is an advantage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
and of a very high order, in our not having this
well-known anchoring ground, if I may so term
it. We are less likely to lose the consciousness
of our true condition in this life; less likely to
forget that while sailing in the ocean of life we
are always exposed to the buffeting of the
billows, nay, more, to the rock and the quicksand.
The very feeling of desolateness of which you
speak&mdash;for I do not deny having formerly
experienced some sensations of this kind, chiefly
when I used to be long an inmate of the houses
of friends who had wives and families to welcome
them home again after a temporary absence&mdash;this
very feeling led me, and taught me in some
measure habitually to look upwards to my permanent
and never failing inheritance, and to feel
that I was to consider myself here as a pilgrim
and a stranger who had no continuing city but
who sought one to come. Yet this very conviction
is by no means incompatible with the
attachment and enjoyment of home-born pleasures,
which doubtless are natural and virtuous pleasures,
such as it gratifies me and fills me with hope to
see that my very dear Sam relishes with such
vivid delight and that he looks forward to them
with such grateful anticipations.</p>

<p>"I have not time now to explain to you, as
otherwise I would, how it happened that I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
not possess a country house. But I may state
to you in general, that it arose from my not
having a large fortune, compared, I mean, with
my situation, and from the peculiar duties and
circumstances of my life."</p>

<p>"Above all remember <i>the one thing needful</i>. I
had far rather that you should be a true

learned from the impulse of the love of human
estimation as your main principle."</p>

<p>On the 15th of May Mr. F. Buxton moved this
resolution in the House of Commons: "That the
state of slavery is repugnant to the principles of
the British Constitution and of the Christian
Religion, and that it ought to be abolished gradually
throughout the British Colonies with as much expedition
as may be found consistent with a due
regard to the well-being of the parties concerned."
The main point was that all negro children born
after a certain day were to be free.</p>

"<i>May 17, 1823.</i><br />

<p>"The debate was by no means so interesting
as we expected. Buxton's opening speech was not
so good as his openings have before been. His
reply however, though short, was, not sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
indeed, but excellent. I was myself placed
in very embarrassing circumstances from having
at once to decide, without consulting my friends,
on Mr. Canning's offers, if I may so term them.
However, I thank God, I judged rightly, that it
would not be wise to press for more on that night,
as subsequent conversation with our friends
rendered indubitably clear; and on the whole
we have done good service, I trust, by getting
Mr. Canning pledged to certain important reforms.
I should speak of our gain in still stronger terms
but for his (Canning's) chief friend being a West
Indian, Mr. Charles Ellis, a very gentlemanly,
humane man, but by no means free from the
prejudices of his caste.</p>

<p>"It has often been a matter of grief to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
that both Henry and Robert have a sad habit
of appearing, if not of being, inattentive at
church. The former I have known turn half
or even quite round and stare (I use the word
designedly) into the opposite pew. I am not
aware whether you have the same disposition
(real or apparent) to inattention at public
worship. I trust I need not endeavour to
enforce on you that it is a practice to be
watched against with the utmost care. It is
not only a crime in ourselves, but it is a great
stumbling-block of offence to others. The late
Mr. Scott, though an excellent man, had contracted
a habit of staring in general while
reading the prayers of our excellent liturgy;
and he once told me himself he actually did
it most, when his mind was most intent on the
solemn service he was performing. But to others
he appeared looking at the congregation, especially
at any persons entering the chapel, and many
I fear were encouraged to a degree of distraction
and inattention in prayer by the unseemly habit
he had contracted. Now let me entreat you, my
dearest boy, to watch against every approach to
inattention in yourself, and to help dear Henry,
in whom I have remarked the practice, to get
the better of it. I have always found it a
great aid in keeping my thoughts from wandering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
at church to repeat the prayers to myself,
either in a whisper or mentally, as the minister
has being going along, and I highly approve of
making responses, and always when you were
children tried to have you make them; but I
used to think your mother did not join me in this
when you were next to her, partly probably from
her own mind being more closely engaged in
the service&mdash;prayer being the grand means of
maintaining our communication with heaven, and
the life of religion in the soul claiming all
possible attention."</p>

<p>In the next letter Wilberforce mentions that he
had limited his personal expenditure so as to
have larger sums to give away. He says that
he had left off giving claret, then a costly wine,
and some other expensive articles still exhibited by
those of his rank. He speaks strongly against
gratifying all the cravings of fashion, thoughtlessness,
or caprice.</p>


<p>
"<span class="smcap">Barmouth</span>, <i>October 14, 1823.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My very dear Samuel</span>,&mdash;I again take up my
pen to give you my sentiments on the important
subject on which I promised to write to you,
and on which you have kindly asked my advice.
But before I proceed to fulfil this engagement
let me mention what I had intended to state
in my last, but omitted, that I have reason to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
believe dear Robert has suffered in the estimation
of some of my friends, whether rightly or wrongly
I really know not, from the idea that his associates
were not religious men (irreligious in its common
acceptation would convey more than I mean), and
therefore that he preferred that class of companions.
Now when people have once conceived
anything of a prejudice against another, on whatever
grounds, they are disposed to view all he
says and does with different eyes, and to draw
from it different conclusions from those which
would otherwise have been produced, and I suspect
dear Robert has suffered unjustly in this
way. However, he will, I doubt not, live through
it, and so long as all is really right, I care less
for such temporary misconceptions, though, by the
way, they may be very injurious to the temporal
interests, and to the acceptance of the subject
of them.</p>

<p>"But now let me state to you my sentiments
concerning your principles and conduct as to
society, and first I must say that if I were in
your case I should be very slow in forming new
acquaintances. Having already such good companions
in Robert, Sir G. Prevost, and I hope
Ryder, it would surely be wise to be satisfied
with them at the first, unless there were any in
whose instance I was sure I was on safe and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
good ground. But now to your question itself.
There are two points of view in which this
subject of good associates must naturally be
regarded. The one in that which is the ordinary
object of social intercourse, that I mean of
recreation: for it certainly is one of the very
best recreations, and may be rendered indeed not
merely such, but conducive to higher and better
ends. On this first head, however, I trust I need
say nothing in your case, I will therefore pass it
by for the present. It would, I am persuaded, be
no recreation to you to be in a party which should
be disgraced by obscenity or profaneness. But
the second view is that which most belongs to
our present inquiry&mdash;that, I mean, of the society
in which it may appear necessary to take a
share on grounds of conformity (where there is
nothing wrong) to the ordinary customs of life,
and even on the principle of 'providing things
honest in the sight of all men' (honest in the
Greek is &#948;&#7985;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#987;) and not suffering your good to
be evil spoken of. Now in considering this
question, I am persuaded I need not begin in
my dear Samuel's instance with arguing for,
but may assume the principle that there are no
indifferent actions properly speaking, I should
rather say none with which religion has nothing
to do. This however is the commonly received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
doctrine of those who consider themselves as very
good Christians. Just as in Law it is an axiom,
'De minimis non curat lex.' On the contrary, a
true Christian holds, in obedience to the injunction,
'Whatever you do in word or deed' that the
desire to please his God and Saviour must be
universal. It is thus that the habit of living in
Christ, and to Christ is to be formed. And the
difference between real and nominal Christians is
more manifest on small occasions than on greater.
In the latter all who do not disclaim the authority
of Christ's commands must obey them, but in the
former only they will apply them who do make
religion their grand business, and pleasing their
God and Saviour, and pleasing, instead of grieving
the Spirit, their continual and habitual aim. We
are therefore to decide the question of the company
you should keep on Scriptural principles,
and the principle I lately quoted 'Provide things
honest,' &amp;c. (There are several others of a like
import, and I think they are not always sufficiently
borne in mind by really good people, this of
course forbids all needless singularities, &amp;c.) That
principle must doubtless be kept in view. But
again, <i>you</i> will not require me to prove that it
can only have any jurisdiction where there is
nothing wrong to be participated in or encouraged.
And therefore I am sure you will not deny that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
ought not to make a part of any society in which
you will be hearing what is indecent or profane.
I hope that there are not many of the Oriel
undergraduates from whom you would be likely to
hear obscenity or profaneness, and I trust that
you will not knowingly visit any such. As to the
wine parties, if I have a correct idea of them
they are the young men going after dinner to
each other's rooms to drink their wine, eat their
fruit, &amp;c.; and with the qualification above specified,
I see no reason for your absenting yourself
from them, if your so doing would fairly subject
you to the charge of moroseness or any other evil
imputation. I understand there is no excess, and
that you separate after a short time. Its being
more <i>agreeable</i> to you to stay away I should not
deem a legitimate motive if alone. But in all
these questions the <i>practical</i> question often is, how
the expenditure of any given amount of time and
money (for the former I estimate full as highly
as the latter) can be made productive of the best
effect. There is one particular member of your
college with whom I hope you will form no
acquaintance. Would it make it more easy for
you to avoid this, if you were able to allege that I
had exacted from you a promise to that effect?
It was not from Robert, but from another person,
that I heard of him a particular instance of misconduct,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
which I believe even in the more relaxed
discipline of Cambridge would have drawn on the
offender exemplary punishment. Such a man must,
I am sure, be a very dangerous companion. If
it be necessary for you to know him, of course
you will treat him like a gentleman; but further
than this I hope you will not go. From what
Robert said to me I have a notion that there is
a very foolish practice, to call it by the softest
name, of spending considerable sums in the fruit
and wine of these wine drinkings, where I understood
that there was no excess, every man also
being allowed to please himself as to the wine he
drinks. But for a young man, the son perhaps
of a clergyman who is straining to the utmost to
maintain him at college, stinting himself, his wife
and daughters in comforts necessary to their
health, for such a young man to be giving claret
and buying expensive fruit for his young companions
is absolutely criminal. And what is more,
I will say that young men are much altered if
any youth of spirit who should frankly declare,
'My father cannot afford such expensive indulgences,
and I will not deprive him or my brothers
and sisters for my own gratification,' would not be
respected for his manliness and right feeling.
Your situation is different, though, by the way,
your father has left off giving claret except in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
some very special cases, and has entirely left off
several other expensive articles, which are still
exhibited by others of his rank. But then I know
this will not commonly be imputed to improper
parsimony in me. And if you or any other
Oxonian could lighten the pressure on young men
going to college, you would be rendering a highly
valuable service to the community, besides the too
little considered obligation of limiting our own
expenditure for our own indulgence as much as
we can, consistently with 'good report,' and with
not suffering our good to be evil spoken of. I
say this deliberately, that it is a duty not sufficiently
borne in mind even by real Christians,
when we read the <i>strong</i> passage in the 15th of
Deuteronomy, and still more when we remember
our Saviour's language in the 25th of St. Matthew,
we shall see reason to be astonished that the
<i>generality</i> of those who do fear God, and mean
in the main to please Him, can give away so
small a proportion of their fortunes, and so little
appear sensible of the obligation under which they
lie to economise as much as they can for the
purpose of having the funds for giving away
within their power. We serve a kind Master,
who will even accept the will for the deed when
the deed was not in our power. But this will not
be held to be the case when we can gratify all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
the cravings of fashion and self-indulgence, or even
thoughtlessness or caprice. What pleasure will a
true Christian sometimes feel in sparing himself
some article which he would be glad to possess,
and putting the price instead into his charity
purse, looking up to his Saviour and in heart
offering it up to His use. Oh, my very dear
Samuel, be not satisfied with the name of
Christian. But strive to be a Christian 'in life
and in power and in the Holy Ghost.' I think a
solitary walk or ride now and then would afford
an excellent opportunity for cultivating <i>spirituality
of mind</i>, the grand characteristic of the thriving
Christian.</p>

<p>"But my feelings draw me off from the proper
subject I was writing upon&mdash;expense. And really,
when I consider it merely in the view of the
misery that may be alleviated, and the tears that
may be wiped away by a very little money judiciously
employed, I grow ashamed of myself for
not practising more self-denial that I may apply
my savings to such a purpose. Then think of
the benefits to be rendered to mankind by missionary
societies. Besides all this, I really believe
there is commonly a special blessing on the
liberal, even in this life, and on their children;
and I hesitate not to say to you that, as you will,
I hope, possess from me what, with the ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
emoluments of a profession, may afford you a
comfortable competence, I am persuaded I shall
leave you far more likely to be happy than if
you were to have inherited from me £10,000
more (and I say the same for your brothers also),
the fruits of my bachelor savings. In truth, it
would be so if the Word of God be true, for it is
full of declarations to that effect. Now all this is
general doctrine. I am aware of it. I can only
give you principles here. It must be for you to
apply them, and if you apply them with simplicity
of intention, all, I doubt not, will be well. But
again I cannot help intimating my persuasion that
you would do well to confine yourself at first to
the few friends you already have and on whom
you can depend. And also let me suggest that
it would be truly wise to be looking around you,
and if you should see anyone whose principles,
and character, and manners are such as suggest
the hope that he might be desirable even for a
friend, then to cultivate his acquaintance. May
our Heavenly Father direct and prosper you,
carry you safely through the ordeal into which
you are just about to enter, and at length receive
you into that blessed world where danger will be
over, and all will be love and peace and joy for
evermore.</p>

<p>"As I was talking to your mother this morning on
money matters it shot across my mind that you had
desired me to send you a supply, which I had neglected
to do. I am truly sorry for my inadvertency,
and will send you the half of a £20 bank note which
I happen to possess, the other half following of course
to-morrow. Ask for what you want, and we will settle
when you are here. It gives me real pleasure to
believe that you are economical on principle, and it
is only by being so that one can be duly liberal.
Without self-denial every man, be his fortune what
it may, will find himself unable to act as he ought in
this particular, not that <i>giving</i> is always the best
charity, far from it; employing people is often a far
preferable mode of serving them. To you I may
say that if I have been able to be liberal not less
before my marriage than after it, it was from denying
myself many articles which persons in my own rank
of life and pecuniary circumstances almost universally
indulged in. Now when I find my income considerably
decreased on the one hand, and my expenses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
(from my four sons) greatly increased on
the other, economy must even be made parsimony,
which, justly construed, does not in my meaning at
all exclude generosity."</p>

<p>This letter is here interrupted, he says, by "two
young widows&mdash;both of whom had recently lost their
husbands in India&mdash;with their four little children, all
in deep mourning. Yet the two widows have the
best of all supports in the assured persuasion that
their husbands were truly pious, and in the hope
that they themselves are so."</p>

<p>It is easy to imagine the reception given to the
"two young widows" by Wilberforce. He had
not yet learned the lesson of "economy or even
parsimony" as regarded his charities&mdash;even when he
had to reduce his expenses he spent £3,000<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> in one

that prevails as I conceive is, it's being thought
right that all persons who are received on the
footing of gentlemen are to live alike. And without
economy there cannot be sufficient liberality. I can
sincerely declare that my wish that my sons should
be economical, which is quite consistent with being
generous, nay, as I said before, is even necessary to
it, arises far more from my conviction of the effects
of economical habits on their minds and happiness
in future life, than on account of the money that
will be thereby saved. You have heard me, I

<p>"You ask me about your Uncle Stephen's having
been a newspaper reporter. He was. The case was
this. At the age of, I believe, eighteen, he came up to
town to study the law, when the sudden death of his
father not only stopped his supplies, but threw on
his hands the junior branches of the family, more
especially three or four sisters. Seeing no other
resource, he embraced an offer, made to him I
believe through or by Mr. Richardson, the friend of
poor Sheridan. Richardson afterwards came into
Parliament, and the fact respecting Stephen came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
out thus, a few years ago. A regulation was proposed
by some of the benchers of Lincoln's Inn that
no one should be permitted to be called to the Bar
who ever had practised the reporting art. Sheridan
brought the question forward in the House of
Commons. Stephen, who was then in Parliament,
spoke to the question, and in arguing against the
illiberal and even cruel severity of the regulation, put
a supposed case, that the son of a gentleman, by a
father's sudden death was at once deprived of the
means of pursuing the legal profession on which he
was just entering, being also harassed in his mind
by the distressed state of some affectionate sisters.
Thus embarrassed, he received an offer of employment
as a reporter, and gladly accepted it and
discharged its duties, thereby being enabled to
prosecute his professional studies as well as to assist
his relatives. 'But,' added Stephen, 'the case I
have just stated is no imaginary one. It is the story
of a living individual. It is that, sir, of the individual
who has now the honour to address you.'
There is in all bodies of Englishmen a generous
feeling which is always called forth powerfully when
a man confesses, or rather boldly avows any circumstance
respecting himself which, according to the
false estimate of the world, might be supposed to
disparage him; as when Peel at the meeting for a
monument to James Watt declared that, 'owing all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
his prosperity to the successful industry of a person
originally in the humble walks of life,' the applause
was overpowering. And I never remember a more
general or louder acclamation than immediately
broke out when Stephen had (indeed before he had
completely) closed his declaration."</p>

the house of Pole &amp; Co. He became a partner
about five months ago. The storm through which
he has been passing has been indeed violent; but
the call for self-possession, temper, judgment, and
above all scrupulous, punctilious integrity has been
abundantly answered. He has behaved so as to
draw on him the universal applause of all who have
witnessed his conduct. Mr. Jno. Smith especially
speaks of it in the highest terms, and has been
acting towards him with corresponding generosity
and kindness. It has been very strikingly evidenced
that commercial transactions on a great scale enlarge
the mind, and the obedience which, with men of real
principle, is paid to the point of mercantile honour,
produces a habit of prompt, decisive integrity in circumstances
of embarrassment and distress. I am
happy to be able to tell you that there is reason to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>

<p>"You may have heard me mention, that when in
my solitary bachelor state I was alone all day on
the Sunday, I used after dinner to call up before
me the images of my friends and acquaintances,
and to consider how I could benefit or gratify them.
And when the mind is scarcely awake, or, at least,
active enough for any superior purpose, this is no
bad employment for a part of the day, especially
if practised with religious associations and purposes.
The day is so raw here that I have yielded to your
mother's kind entreaties that I would not go to
church, where the greater part of the family now
is at afternoon service. So I am glad to spend
a part of my day with my dearest Samuel.</p>

<p>"I will remind you of an idea which I threw out
on the day preceding your departure&mdash;that I feared
I had scarcely enough endeavoured to impress on
my children the idea that they must as Christians be
a peculiar people. I am persuaded that you cannot
misunderstand me to mean that I wish you to affect
singularity in indifferent matters. The very contrary
is our duty. But from that very circumstance
of its being right that we should be like the rest of
the world in exterior, manners, &amp;c., &amp;c., results an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
augmentation of the danger of our not maintaining
that diversity, nay, that contrast, which the Eye of
God ought to see in us to the worldly way of
thinking and feeling on all the various occasions of
life, and in relation to its various interests. The
man of the world considers religion as having
nothing to do with 99-100ths of the affairs of life,
considering it as a medicine and not as his food,
least of all as his refreshment and cordial. He
naturally takes no more of it than his health requires.
How opposite this to the apostle's admonition,
'Whatever ye do in word or deed, do all in the
name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the
Father through Him.' This is being spiritually-minded,
and being so is truly declared to be life and
peace. By the way, if you do not possess that
duodecimo volume, 'Owen on Spiritual Mindedness,'
let me beg you to get and read it carefully. There
are some obscure and mystic passages, but much that
I think is likely to be eminently useful; and may our
Heavenly Father bless to you the perusal of it...."</p>


<p>
"<i>February 27, 1826.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"Let me assure you that you give me great
pleasure by telling me unreservedly any doubts you
may entertain of the propriety of my principles or
conduct. I love your considering and treating me
as a friend, and I trust you will never have reason
to regret your having so done, either in relation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
your benefit or your comfort. In stating my
suspicions that I had not sufficiently endeavoured
to impress on my children, and that you were
scarcely enough aware of the force of the dictum
that Christians were to be a peculiar people, I
scarcely need assure you that I think the commands,
'Provide things honest in the sight of all men,
whatever things are lovely, whatsoever of good
report,' &amp;c. (admirably illustrated and enforced by
St. Paul's account of his own principles of becoming
all things to all men), clearly prove that so far from
being needlessly singular, we never ought to be so,
but for some special and good reason. Again, I
am aware of what you suggest that, in our days, in
which the number of those who profess a stricter
kind of religion than the world of <i>soi-disant</i> Christians
in general, there is danger lest a party spirit
should creep in with its usual effects and evils.
Against this, therefore, we should be on the watch.
And yet, though not enlisting ourselves in a party,
we ought, as I think you will admit, to assign considerable
weight to any opinions or practices which
have been sanctioned by the authority of good men
in general. As again, you will I think admit, that
in any case in which the more advanced Christians
and the less advanced are both affected, the former
and their interests deserve more of our consideration
than the latter. For instance, it is alleged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
in behalf of certain worldly compliances, that by
making them you will give a favourable idea,
produce a pleasing impression of your religious
principles, and dispose people the rather to adopt
them. But then, if you thereby are likely to
become an <i>offence</i> (in the Scripture sense) to
weaker Christians, (persons, with all their infirmities,
eminently dear to Christ,) you may do more harm
than good, and that to the class which had the
stronger claim to your kind offices. Let my dear
Samuel think over the topic to which I was about
next to proceed. I mean our Saviour's language
to the Laodicean Church expressing His abhorrence
and disgust at lukewarmness, and the danger
of damping the religious affections by such recreations
as He had in mind. Of course I don't
object to domestic dances. It is not the act, the
<i>saltus</i>, but the <i>whole tone</i> of an assembly."</p>

melancholy which might sadden the whole scene,
and even produce, by permanent association, a
lasting impression of despondency. I finish this
letter after hearing an excellent sermon from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
Robert Hall. It was not merely an exhibition of
powerful intellect, but of fervent and feeling piety,
especially impressing on his hearers to live by the
faith of the love of Christ daily, habitually looking
to Him in all His characters. Prayer, prayer, my
dear Samuel; let your religion consist much in
prayer. May you be enabled more and more to
walk by faith and not by sight, to feel habitually
as well as to recognise in all your more deliberate
calculations and plans, that the things that are seen
are temporal, but the things that are not seen are
eternal. Then you will live above the world, as one

<p>"I am thankful to reflect that at the very moment

also are probably engaged in some religious exercise,
solitary or social (for I was much gratified by
learning from a passage in one of your letters to
your mother that you and Anderson went through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>

<p>"I am not sure whether or not I told you of our
having been for a week at Lea,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> having been detained
there by my being slightly indisposed. But
it was worth while to be so, if it were only to
witness, or rather to experience, Lady Anderson's
exceeding kindness. I really do not recollect having
ever before known such high merits and accomplishments&mdash;the
pencil and music combined with such
unpretending humility, such true simplicity and
benevolence. With these last Sir Charles is also
eminently endowed. He reads his family prayers
with great feeling, and especially with a reverence
which is always particularly pleasing to me. There
is, in 'Jonathan Edwards on the Religious Affections,'
a book from which you will, I think, gain
much useful matter, a very striking passage, in
which he condemns with great severity, but not at
all too great, <i>me judice</i>, that familiarity with the
Supreme King which was affected by some of the
religionists of his day, as well as by Dr. Hawker
recently, and remarks very truly that Moses and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Elijah, and Abraham the friend of God (and all of
them honoured by such especial marks of the Divine
condescension), always manifested a holy awe and
reverence when in the Divine presence."</p>

<p>Samuel Wilberforce had written to his father
asking him what advice he should give to a friend
whose family was very irreligious. In the house
of this friend 'it was a common phrase accompanying
a shake of each other's hands on meeting,
"May we meet together in <i>hell</i>."' The answer to
the appeal for advice is as follows:&mdash;</p>


<p>
"<i>July 28, 1826.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"I will frankly confess to you that the clearness
and strength of the command of the apostle,
'Children, obey your parents in all things' (though
in one passage it is added, 'in the Lord') weighed
so strongly with me as to lead me, at first, to doubt
whether or not it did not overbalance all opposing
considerations and injunctions, yet more reflection
has brought me to the conclusion, to which almost
all those whom I consulted came still more promptly,
that it is the duty of your young friend to resist his
parents' injunction to go to the play or the opera.
That they are quite hotbeds of vice no one, I think,
can deny, for much more might be said against
them than is contained in my 'Practical View,' though
I own the considerations there stated appear to my
understanding such as must to anyone who means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
to act on Christian principles be perfectly decisive.
One argument against the young man's giving
up the point in these instances, which has great
weight with me, is this, that he must either give
himself entirely up to his friends and suffer them at
least to dictate to him his course of conduct, or
make a stand somewhere. Now I know not what
ground he will be likely to find so strong as this
must be confessed to be, by all who will argue the
question with him on Scriptural principles, and more
especially on those I have suggested in my 'Practical
View' of the love of God, and I might have added,
that of the apostle's injunction, 'Whatever ye do
in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord
Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father through
Him.' I scarcely need remark that the refusal
should be rendered as unobjectionable as possible
by the modest and affectionate manner of urging it,
and by endeavouring to render the whole conduct
and demeanour doubly kind and assiduous. I well
remember that when first it pleased God to touch
my heart, now rather above forty years ago, it had
been reported of me that I was deranged, and various
other rumours were propagated to my disadvantage.
It was under the cloud of these prejudices that I
presented myself to some old friends, and spent
some time with them (after the close of the session)
at Scarborough. I conversed and behaved in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
spirit above recommended, and I was careful to
embrace any little opportunity of pleasing them
(little presents often have no small effects), and I
endeavoured to impress them with a persuasion that
I was not less happy than before. The consequence
was all I could desire, and I well recollect that the
late Mrs. Henry Thornton's mother, a woman of
very superior powers and of great influence in our
social circle, one day broke out to my mother&mdash;she
afterwards said to me something of the same kind,
not without tears&mdash;'Well, I can only say if <i>he</i> is
deranged I hope we all shall become so.' To your
young friend again I need not suggest the duty of
constant prayer for his nearest relatives. By degrees
they will become softened, and he will probably enjoy
the delight of finding them come over to the blessed
path he is himself pursuing. He will also find that
self-denial, and a disposition to subject himself to
any trouble or annoyance in order to promote his
friends' comfort, or exemption from some grievance,
will have a very powerful effect in conciliating his
friends. With all the courtesy that prevails in high
life, no one, I think, can associate with those who
move in it, without seeing how great a share selfishness
has in deciding their language and conduct,
saving themselves trouble or money, &amp;c., &amp;c.
Happily the objections of worldly parents to their
children becoming religious are considerably weakened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
since it has pleased God to diffuse serious
religion so much through the higher ranks in society:
they no longer despair, as they once did, of their sons
and daughters not forming any eligible matrimonial
alliance or any respectable acquaintances or friendships.
The grand blessing of acting in the way I
recommend is the peace of conscience it is likely to
produce. There are, we know, occasions to which
our Saviour's words must apply, 'He that loveth
father and mother more than Me is not worthy of
Me,' and I doubt not that if your friend does the
violence to his natural feelings which the case supposes,
in the spirit of faith and prayer, he will be
rewarded even by a present enjoyment of spiritual
comfort. If I mistake not I wrote to you lately on
the topic of the joy which Christians ought to find
familiar to them, still more the peace; and the
course he would pursue would, I believe, be very
likely to ensure the possession of them. We have
been, and still are, highly gratified by finding true
religion establishing itself more and more widely.
Lord Mandeville, whose parent stock on both sides
must be confessed to be as unfavourable as could
be well imagined in this highly favoured country, is
truly in earnest. He, you may have forgot, married
Lady Olivia's only daughter. He is a man of very
good sense; though having been destined to the
Navy, which had been for generations a family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
service, his education was probably not quite such
as one would wish. He is a man of the greatest
simplicity of character, only rather too quiet and
silent."</p>

that by far the larger part of the worthies the work
commemorates were carried off before they reached
to the age I have attained to. And yet, as I think,
I must have told you, Dr. Warren, the first medical
authority of that day, declared in 1788 that I could
not then last above two or three weeks, not so much
from the violence of an illness from which I had
then suffered, as from the utter want of stamina.
Yet a gracious Providence has not only spared my
life, but permitted me to see several of my dear
children advancing into life, and you, my dear
Samuel, as well as Robert, about to enter into Holy

spare my life for about a couple of years, which
according to my present state of health seems by no

pleasure of witnessing your performance of the
sacred service of the Church. It is little in me&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
mean a very ordinary proof of my preference of
spiritual to earthly things, of my desiring to walk
rather by faith than by sight&mdash;that I rejoice in the
prospect of your becoming a clergyman rather than
a lawyer, which appeared the alternative in your
instance; but it is due to you, my dear Samuel, to
say that it is a very striking proof of your having
been enabled by, I humbly trust, the highest of all
influences, to form this decision, when from your
talents and qualifications it appeared by no means
improbable that in the legal line you might not
improbably rise into the enjoyment of rank and
affluence. It is but too true that my feelings would,
at your time of life, have been powerfully active in
another direction. Perhaps this very determination
may have been in part produced by that connection
to which you look forward. And may it please God,
my dear Samuel, to grant you the desire of your
heart in this particular and to render the union conducive
to your spiritual benefit and that of your
partner also, so that it may be looked back upon
with gratitude even in a better world, as that which

His language remarkably simple, much every way

one or two important topics for consideration, which
I shall be glad to talk over with you hereafter, as
well as with Robert himself. One is, whether he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>

in the sermons of sound divines, and in those

mean of addressing their congregations as being all
real Christians&mdash;children of God, &amp;c.&mdash;who needed
(to use our Saviour's figure in John xiii.) only to
have their feet washed. Whatever may be the right
doctrinal opinion as to baptismal regeneration, all
really orthodox men will grant, I presume, that as
people grow up they may lose that privilege of
being children of God which we trust they who
were baptised in their infancy did enjoy, and would
have reaped the benefit of it had they died before,
by the gradual development of their mental powers,
they became moral agents capable of responsibility.
And if so, should not their particular sins of disposition,
temper, or conduct be used rather to
convince them of their being in a sinful state, and
as therefore requiring the converting grace of God,
than as merely wanting a little reformation?"</p>

yourself to the whole duty. With such a scattered
population, there must be a call I conceive for great
bodily strength. Secondly, the situation appears to
me still less eligible considered on higher grounds.
It is no ground of blame to you that your studies
have not hitherto been of divinity. Supply all that
I should say under that head, were I not writing to
one who is capable himself of suggesting it to his
own mind. Again, you cannot have that acquaintance
with human nature, either in general, or in your
own self, which it would be desirable for any one to
possess who was to be placed in so wide and
populous a field, especially in one so circumstanced
as this particular place. Then you would be at a
distance from almost all your friends, which I mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
now in reference to the spiritual disadvantages
of the situation, not in relation to your comfort and
Emily's, in which, however, it may be fairly admitted
to some weight. Again, <i>I</i> should much regret your
being placed where you would naturally be called to
study controversial anti-Roman Catholic divinity,
rather than that which expects the cultivation of
personal holiness in yourself and your parishioners.
I could say much on this head. Thirdly, Mr.
Neale sees the objections on the ground of pecuniary
interest, as alone of so much weight, as to warrant
your refusing the offer&mdash;a vicarage. Its income is
commonly derived from small payments, and in that
district probably of poor people whom you would
not, could not squeeze, and yet without squeezing
from whom you probably would get nothing. Most
likely a curate would be indispensable."</p>

<p>On the same topic Wilberforce writes again:&mdash;</p>


<p>
"<i>March 17th, 1829.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"I ought to tell you that in the reasons I assigned
to the Bishop for declining his offer, one, and in
itself perhaps the strongest, (nay, certainly so, not
perhaps,) was my persuasion that for any one
educated and associated as you have been, it was
of very great importance with a view to your
spiritual state, (more especially for the cultivation
of devotional feelings and spirituality of mind,) that
he should in the outset of his ministerial course be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
for some time in a quiet and retired situation, where
he could live in the enjoyment of domestic comfort,
of leisure for religious reading and meditation, and
devotional exercises; while, on the contrary, it was
very undesirable in lieu of these to be placed in
circumstances in which he would almost necessarily
be almost incessantly arguing for Protestant
principles&mdash;in short, would be occupied in the religion
of the head rather than of the heart. I own to
you in confidence (though I believe I shall make
the avowal to my dear Robert himself) that I am
sometimes uneasy on a ground somewhat congenial
with this, about the tutor of Oriel. For though I
doubt not the solidity of his religious character, yet
I fear his situation is far from favourable to the
growth in grace, and would, alas! need every help
we can have for the advancement of personal
religion within us, and can scarcely bear without
injury any circumstances that have an unfavourable
tendency. I trust my dear Samuel will himself
consider that he is now responsible for living in
circumstances peculiarly favourable to the growth
of personal piety, and therefore that he should use
his utmost endeavours to derive the benefits that
appear, (humanly speaking,) to be placed within his
reach. Oh, my dearest boy, we are all too sadly
lukewarm, sadly too little urging forward with the
earnestness that might justly be expected from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
those that are contending for an incorruptible
crown. Did you ever read Owen on spiritual-mindedness?
There are some passages that to
me appear almost unintelligible (one at least), but
it is in the main, I think, a highly useful book. I
need not say how sorry we are to hear of Emily
being poorly. But our gourds must have something
to alloy their sweets. D. G. your mother
is recovering gradually, and now profits much from
a jumbling pony-chair; its shaking quality renders
its value to her double what it would be otherwise."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>"In speaking of Whately's book I ought to
have said that I had not got to the part in which
he speaks of imputed righteousness. I remember
it was an objection made to my 'Practical View'
by a certain strange head of a college that I was
silent on that point. The honest truth is, I never
considered it. I have always been disposed to
believe it to be in some sort true, but not to deem
it a matter of importance, if the doctrine of free
grace and justification by faith be held, which are,
I believe, of primary importance. Hooker, unless
I forget, is clearly for it; see his sermon on Justification.
I trust I need not fear your misconstruing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
me, and supposing I can be advising you, either to
be roguish, or shabbily reserved. But really I do
think that you may produce an unfavourable and
false impression of your principles and professional
character, by talking unguardedly about <i>Methodistical</i>
persons and opinions. Mrs. R. may report you as
<span class="smcap">UNSOUND</span> to the Bishop of Winchester, and he
imbibe a prejudice against you. Besides, my dear
Samuel, I am sure you will not <i>fire</i> when I say
that you may see reason on farther reading, and
reflection, and more experience to change or qualify
some of the opinions you may now hold. I own,
(I should not be honest if I did not say so,) that I
think I have myself witnessed occasions which have
strengthened with me the impression that you may
need this hint.... Have you any parishioners who
have been used to hear Methodists or Dissenters, or
have you any who appear to have had, or still to
have, much feeling of religion? I cannot help
suspecting that it is a mistaken notion that the
lower orders are to be chiefly instructed in the
ordinary practical duties of religion, whereas I own
I believe them to be quite capable of impressions
on their affections: on the infinite love of their
God and Redeemer, and of their corresponding
obligation to Love and Obedience. We found
peasants more open to attacks on their consciences,
on the score of being wanting in gratitude, than on
any other."</p>

Sermons (2 vols.), White's 'Selborne' (2 vols.

lending library is, I think, likely to be considerably
beneficial. It cannot but have a tendency to
generate in the poor a disposition favourable to
domestic habits and pleasures, and to seek their
enjoyments at home rather than in the alehouse,
and it strikes me as likely to confirm this taste, to
encourage the poor people's children to read to
them. Send me a list of any books you will like
to have for your lending library, and I will by

<p>"We ought to be always making it our endeavour

ought not to acquiesce quietly in the want of them,
whereas we are too apt to be satisfied if our consciences
do not reproach us with anything wrong,
if we can on good grounds entertain the persuasion
that we are safe; and we do not sufficiently consider
that we serve a gracious and kind master who is
willing that we should taste that He is gracious.
Both in St. John's first general Epistle, and in our

our joy may be full. It is a great comfort to me
to reflect that you are in circumstances peculiarly
favourable to your best interests. To be spiritually-minded
is both life and peace. How much happier
would your dear mother be if she were living the
quiet life you and Emily do, instead of being

in conjunction with Mr. Burke. The latter had
addressed his electors in a fuller effusion of
eloquence than was used to flow even from his
lips, when his colleague, conscious that he should
appear to great disadvantage were he to attempt a
speech, very wisely confined himself to, 'Gentlemen,
you have heard Mr. Burke's excellent speech.

what I witnessed at Checkendon,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and how it

to whose future course I can look with so much
humble hope, and even joyful confidence. It is
also with no little thankfulness that I reflect on
your domestic prospects, from the excellent qualities
of your, let me say <i>our</i>, dear Emily. I must stop,
the rest shall be prayer, prayer for both of you, that
your course in this life may be useful and honourable,
and that you may at length, accompanied by
a large assemblage of the sheep of Christ, whom
you have been the honoured instrument of bringing
to the fold of Christ, have an abundant entrance
into the everlasting kingdom of God."</p>

<p>"How much do they lose of comfort, as well as,
I believe, in incentives to gratitude and love, and if
it be not their own fault thereby in the means of
practical improvement, who do not accustom themselves
to watch the operations of the Divine Hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
I have often thought that, had it not been for the
positive declarations of the Holy Scriptures concerning
the attention of the Almighty Governor of
the universe to our minutest comforts and interests
enforced by a comparison with the &#963;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#947;&#7969; of parental
affection, we should not dare to be so presumptuous
as to believe, that He who rolls the spheres along,
would condescend thus to sympathise with our
feelings, and attend to our minutest interests. Here
also Dr. Chalmers' suggestions, derived from the
discoveries made to us through the microscope,
come in to confirm the same delightful persuasion.
I am persuaded that many true Christians lose
much pleasure they might otherwise enjoy from not
sufficiently watching the various events of their
lives, more especially in those little incidents, as
we rather unfitly term them; for, considering them
as links in the chain, they maintain the continuity,
as much as those which we are apt to regard as of
greater size and consequence."</p>

told you the memorabilia of this visit, and especially
the inexhaustible conversational powers of Sir

time or other, to enable you to hear these powers
exerted. Poor fellow! he is, however, the victim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>

<p>"We ought not to expect this life to flow on
smoothly without rubs or mortification. Indeed, it
is a sentiment which I often inculcate on myself
that, to use a familiar phrase, we here have more
than our bargain, as Christians, in the days in which
we live; for I apprehend the promise of the life
that now is, combined with that which is to come,
was meant to refer rather to mental peace and
comfort, than to temporal prosperity. My thoughts
have been of late often led into reflections on the
degree in which we are wanting to ourselves, in
relation to the rich and bright prospects set before
us as attainable in the Word of God. More
especially I refer to that of the Christian's hope
and peace and joy. Again and again we are
assured that joy is ordinarily and generally to be
the portion of the Christian. Yet how prone are
but too commonly those, whom we really believe
to be entitled to the name of Christians, disposed
to remain contented without the possession of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
delightful state of heart; and to regard it as the
privilege of some rarely gifted, and eminently
favoured Christians, rather than as the general
character of all, yet I believe that except for some
hypochondriacal affection, or state of spirits arising
from bodily ailments, every Christian ought to be
very distrustful of himself, <i>and to call himself to
account, as it were</i>, if he is not able to maintain a
settled frame of 'inward peace,' if not joy. It is
to be obtained through the Holy Spirit, and therefore
when St. Paul prays for the Roman Christians
that they may be filled with all <i>peace</i> and <i>joy</i> in
believing, and may abound in hope, it is added,
through the power of the Holy Ghost."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Children</span>,&mdash;For to both of you I
address myself. An idea, which for so old a fellow
as myself you will allow somewhat to be deserving
the praise of brightness, has just struck my mind,
and I proceed to act upon it. Are you Yorkshireman
enough to know the article (an excellent one it
is) entitled a Christmas, or sometimes a goose or a
turkey pie? Its composition is this. Take first
the smallest of eatable birds, as a snipe, for instance,
then put it within its next neighbour of the feathered
race, I mean in point of size, the woodcock, insert
the two into a teal, the teal into a duck, the duck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
and Co. into a fowl, the fowl into a goose, the goose
and Co. into a turkey. In imitation of this laudable
precedent, I propose, though with a variation, as our
Speaker would say, in the order of our proceeding,
that this large sheet which I have selected for the
purpose should contain the united epistles of all the
family circle, from the fullest grown if not largest in
dimensions, myself, to the most diminutive, little
William.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> As the thought is my own, I will begin
the execution of it, and if any vacant space should
remain, I will fill it, just as any orifices left vacant
in said pie are supplied by the pouring in of the
jelly. But I begin to be ashamed of this jocoseness
when I call to mind on what day I am writing&mdash;the
day which, combined with the succeeding one, the
1st of January, I consider, except perhaps my birthday,
as the most important of the whole year. For
a long period (as long as I lived in the neighbourhood
of the Lock, or rather not far from it) I
used to receive the Sacrament, which was always
administered there on New Year's Day. And the
heart must be hard and cold, which that sacred
ordinance in such a relation, would not soften and
warm into religious sensibility and tenderness. I
was naturally led into looking backwards to the
past days of my life, and forward to the future; led to
consider in what pleasant places my lines were fallen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
how goodly was my heritage, that the bounds of
my life should be fixed in that little spot, in which, of
the whole earth, there has been the greatest measure
of temporal comforts, and of spiritual privileges.
That it should be also in the eighteenth century,
for where should I have been, a small, weakly man,
had I been born either among our painted or skin-clothed
ancestors, or in almost any other before or
after it? As they would have begun by exposing
me, there need be no more inquiry as to the sequel
of the piece. Next take my station in life, neither
so high as naturally to intoxicate me, nor so low as
to excite to envy or degradation. Take then the
other particulars of my condition, both personal and
circumstantial. But I need go no farther, but leave
it to you to supply the rest. And you will likewise,
I doubt not, pursue the same mental process in your
own instance also, and find, as may well be the case,
that the retrospect and prospect afford abundant
matter for gratitude and humiliation, (I am sure I
find the latter most powerfully called forth in my
heart by my own survey). Many thanks for your
last kind letter. You have precisely anticipated
what was said by the several <i>dramatis personæ</i>. It
is a real sacrifice for Emily and you to be absent
from my family circle. But the sacrifice is to duty,
and that is enough. And you have no small ground
for comfort, from your not having to go through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
the 'experiment solitary,' as Lord Bacon terms it,
but to have one, to whom you may say that solitude
is sweet. But I must surrender the pen to your

whence the particulars for the work must be
derived are chiefly Lives and Memoirs. Numbers

not improbable, there would be considerable danger
of his getting into quarrels which might draw on him
challenges, the more probably because people might
suppose from his parentage, &amp;c., that he most likely
would not answer a call to the field. I must say
that the becoming exempt, even in the world's

challenged may be no unfair principle of preference
of an ecclesiastical profession to any other. The

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Emily</span>,&mdash;We had a delightful day
yesterday for our ceremony, and after the indissoluble
knot had been tied in due form, the parties
drove off about 12 o'clock to spend a few days at
Mr. Stephen's favourite residence of Healthy Hill,
as he terms it, Missenden. I really augur well of
this connection, having strong reasons for believing
Mr. James to be a truly amiable as well as pious man,
and my dear Lizzy is really well fitted for the office
of a parson's aider and comforter. It has given me
no little pleasure to have been assured by Mr. Dupré,
the curate of the parish, that she has been truly useful
to the poor cottagers around us. His expression
was, 'She has done more good than she knows of.'
This event, combined with the close of another year
and the anniversary of my own dear wife's birthday,
has called forth in me a lively sense of the goodness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
of that gracious Being who has dealt so bountifully
with me during a long succession of years.
Dr. Warren, in 1788, as I was reminded when at
Brighstone, declared that for want of stamina there
would be an end of my feeble frame in two or
three weeks, and then I was a bachelor. After
this, near ten years after, I became a husband, and
now I have assured me full grown descendants,
and an offset in my Elizabeth. I have been receiving
many congratulations from being perhaps the
only living father of three first-class men, one
of them a double first and the two others in the
second also. Above all their literary acquirements
I value their having, as I verily believe, passed
through the fiery trial of an university, for such I
honestly account it, without injury. And it gives
me no little pleasure (as I think I have before
assured you), to add that I ascribe this in part to
the instrumentality of a certain young lady, who
was a sort of guardian angel hovering around him
in fancy and exerting a benign influence over the
sensibility and tenderness of his lively spirit. Farewell,

<p>
"<i>February 8, 1831.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Samuel</span>,&mdash;Pray both for your mother
and for poor William that they may be delivered
from &#956;&#7953;&#961;&#953;&#956;&#957;&#945;. The former, alas! lies awake for hours
in the morning, and cannot banish from her mind
the carking cares that haunt and worry her. We
profess to believe in the efficacy of prayer. Let us
prove the truth of our profession by at least not
acquiescing, without resistance, in such assailments.
It is more from natural temperament than from any
higher attainment that I am not the prey of these
corrosions. Something may be ascribed to the
habit of controlling my thoughts which I acquired
when in public life.... You might, I believe,
have shone in political life; but you have chosen
the better part. And if you can think so now when
in your younger blood, much more will you become
sensible of it by and by when you look back, if God
should so permit, on a long retrospect, studded with
records of the Divine blessing on your ministerial
exertions. Kindest remembrances to dear Emily,
and a kiss to little Emily, and the blessing of your
affectionate father,</p>

<p>"I will frankly confess to you that I almost tremble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
for the consequences of Lord Russell's plan of Reform
if it should be carried. I wish the qualification
had been higher. The addition to the County Representation
lessens the danger. Much in the judgments
we form on such practical questions depends
on our period of life. I find myself now at seventy-one
and a half far more timid and more indisposed
to great changes, and less inclined to promise myself
great benefit from political plans. I own I
scarcely can expect the plan to succeed, especially
in the House of Lords. We understand your
invitation to be for July and August. But I foretell
you plainly you shall not regularly walk with me, or
break off any habits which can in any degree interfere
with duty. We have not yet settled our plans.
Indeed, they may greatly depend on the convenience
of our friends. I well remember the Dean of
Carlisle used to say when invitations multiplied,
'Do you think that if you wanted a dinner there
would be so many disposed to give you one?' We
are now about to put this to the proof. I own now
that it comes to the point I am a little disposed to
exclaim, 'O happy hills! O pleasing shades!' &amp;c.
But I should be ashamed were I to have any other
prevailing feeling than thankfulness. I feel most the
separation from my books. However, <i>sursum corda</i>."</p>

Lord Russell's propositions:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Tom</span>,&mdash;I fear you will be again
disposed to accuse me of treating you with neglect
(not, I hope, with unkindness) in suffering week after
week to pass away without returning answers to
your kind letters. I have really had as much
necessary writing on my hands, as even when I was
member for Yorkshire. But I cannot bear to think
that you are, day after day, looking out for my handwriting
(as you are opening your daily packets), and
looking out in vain. There have been many topics,
I assure you, on which I should have been glad to
communicate with you had I been able. I know
not how you have felt, but I must say I felt glad by
the consciousness that I was not now in a situation
to be compelled to approach, and act upon, the important
question of Lord John Russell's proposition.
On the whole, I think I should have been favourable
to it; chiefly, or rather most confidently, from
trusting that we shall do away with much vice and
much bribery which now prevail. I am persuaded
also that the change will be for the benefit, and
greatly so, of our poor West India clients.
I should like to know your sentiments on the
plan."</p>

"<i>April 8, 1831.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"And now, my dear Samuel, we have commenced
our wanderings. I write from Daniel Wilson's, who
treats us with the utmost kindness."</p>

<p>From this time Wilberforce had no house of his
own, but spent the remaining years of his life with
his sons and with his friends. In his own language,
he "became a wanderer without any certain dwelling-place."</p>

Brougham, when on the woolsack, called Stephen,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
then attending the House of Lords, quasi master
(two of their description you perhaps know are
required to be always present; they take down their
Lordships' Bills to the House of Commons), and
after expressing in very strong language his concern
at having heard such an account as had reached
him of the state of my finances, and more particularly
of its being necessary for me to quit my own
house, and become a wanderer without any certain
dwelling-place, he stated that he had lately heard of
my having sons and a son-in-law in the Church, and
that he should be most happy to do what he could
for them. Lord Milton afterwards, as I understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
from Dan Sykes, expressed to Lord Brougham
some kind intentions towards me, and more especially
that he waived a claim or an application he had
been making for the living of Rawmarsh, as soon as
he learned that Lord Brougham had destined it to
me. Robert would not accept any living which
would not afford me a suitable residence."</p>

<p>"You cannot conceive how little time I appear to
have at my own command while passing our lives
in this vagarious mode, which, however, calls forth
emotions of gratitude to the Giver of all good, who
has raised up for me so many and so kind friends.
I ought not to forget, while a Gracious Providence
has granted me a good name which is better than
great riches, that many public men as upright as
myself have been the victims of calumny. I
myself indeed have had its envenomed shafts at
times directed against me. But on the whole
few men have suffered from them so little as myself."</p>

<p>"I am but poorly, and I am bothered (a vulgar
phrase, but having been used in the House of Lords
I may condescend to adopt it) with incessant visitors.
There is a person come over to this country from
the United States, of the Society of Quakers, for
the excellent purpose of obtaining popularity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
support for a society which has been in being for
nine or ten years&mdash;the American Colonisation
Society. I could not but assent to his proposal to
pay me a visit at this place. The time was when
such a visitor would have been no encumbrance to
me. But now that he takes me in hand when I
am already tired by others, (though it is only justice
to him to say no one can be less intrusive or more
obliging than he is), I do sink under it. My dear
Samuel, it is one of the bad consequences of the
plan you prescribed that I exhibit myself to you in
the state of mind in which I am at the moment,
though I should not otherwise have selected it for
that purpose.</p>

<p>"Our American friend has left us this morning
But, alas! he has requested me to write in his album.
What a vile system is the album system! No, I do
not, I cannot think so, though I am somewhat
ruffled by being called on for my contingent, when
I have little or no supplies left to furnish it."</p>

<p>Wilberforce goes on to express his gratitude for
the safety of his daughter Elizabeth (Mrs. James),
who had been confined of a daughter.</p>

<p>"The mere circumstance that a new immortal
being is produced and committed to our keeping is a
consideration of extreme moment. Though I own
it sometimes tends to produce emotions of a saddening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
character, to consider into what a world our new
grandchild has entered, what stormy seas she will
have to navigate. I will enclose an interesting
passage I have received from Tom Babington,
giving an account of Dr. Chalmer's speculations.</p>

<p>"I own I am sadly alarmed for the Church. There
is such a combination of noxious elements fermenting
together, that I am ready to exclaim, 'There is
death in the pot,' and there will be, I fear, no Elisha
granted to us to render the mess harmless. But
yet I am encouraged to hope that the same gracious
and longsuffering Being who would have spared
Sodom for ten, and Jerusalem even for one righteous
man's sake, may spare us to the prayers of the many
who do, I trust, sincerely sigh and cry in behalf of
our proud, ungrateful land. Yet, again, when I consider
what light we have enjoyed, what mercies we
have received, and how self-sufficient and ungrateful
we have been, I am again tempted to despond. I
wish I could be a less unprofitable servant. Yet I
must remember Milton's sonnet, 'They also serve
who only stand and wait.' Let us all be found in
our several stations doing therein the Lord's work
diligently and zealously. What do you think
of Shuttleworth's new translation of St. Paul's
Epistles? I have borrowed but not yet read them.
Affectionate remembrances to dear Emily, and a
kiss to sweet baby."</p>

<p>"You will hear what dreadful work has been
going on at Bristol for the last eight and forty
hours. Sir Charles Wetherell<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> escaped from the
fury of the mob by first hiding himself in some
upper room in the Mansion House and then
passing, disguised in a sack jacket, from
the roof of the Mansion House to that of
another house, whence he got to a distant part
of the town, and in a chaise and four returned
in all haste, (they say) to London. He was, as
Recorder, to have opened the Commission and
tried all the prisoners to-day. However, the latter
are now all at work again in their accustomed
callings. Not a single gaol, I am assured, is
left undestroyed. The Bishop's Palace, (and
Deanery too I am told), burnt to the ground.
The Custom House ditto, Mansion House ditto.
Poor Pinney, the Mayor, I was assured, behaved
on Saturday with great presence of mind. The
populace, however, got into the Mansion House
before the corporation went to dinner; so all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
good things regaled the &#8001;&#953; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#953;. Strange to say,
(just as in the London riots), people were allowed
to walk the streets in peace, and last night half the
people in the square were looking on at the depredations
committing by the other half. Well-dressed
ladies walked about great part of the night
staring as at a raree show. The redness of the
sky from the conflagration was quite a dreadful
sight to us in the distance. It is said they are
endeavouring to organise a force for the defence
of the city. It is very strange that this has been
so long delayed. I'm assured pillage has latterly
been the grand object. The deputation, I am told,
were followed by a cart, in which, as they went
along, they stowed the plunder. I have not said
it to your mother, for fear of her becoming still
more nervous,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> (which need not be), by her finding
me entertaining such cogitations, but if I perceive
any grumblings of the volcano at Bath, before the
lava bursts forth I shall hurry your mother to a
certain quiet parsonage&mdash;though, alas! I cannot but
fear for the Church in these days."</p>


<p>
"<span class="smcap">Blaize Castle</span>, <i>November 2.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"The Bristol riots, though in some particulars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
the accounts were as usual exaggerated, were
quite horrible, and the <i>great</i> events as reported.
But a striking instance was afforded how easily
perpetrations, if I may use the word, the most
horrible may be at once arrested by determined
opposition. On Monday morning early the mobs
were parading about without resistance. But on
that morning the troops, a small body of dragoons,
charged them repeatedly at full speed, and not
sparing either the momentum or the sharpness
of their swords, no attempt at making a head
afterwards appeared. Afterwards the day was
properly employed in appointing a great number
of special constables and other civil force, and
every night, as well as day, since has passed in
perfect quiet. A great part of the plunder has
been recovered, and numbers of criminals have
been seized&mdash;some of them sent to a gaol
about seven miles off; and happily the condemned
cells have escaped the fury of the mob,
and have afforded a stronghold for keeping the
prisoners. I need not tell you in what a ferment
the mind of our host was thrown, indeed with
great reason. He had been threatened with a
visit at this place, and the best pictures were
stowed away in safe custody. I am persuaded
it has become indispensably necessary to form in
all our great cities and neighbourhoods a civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
police, properly armed and drilled. And thus, as
usual, out of evil good may arise."</p>


<p>
"<span class="smcap">Bath</span>, <i>November 13, 1831.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"I think you know Mr. Pearse of this place,
an excellent and very agreeable man, and master
of the Grammar School at this place, a large
and flourishing one. He is a very musical man,
an intimate and long attached friend of Dr.
Crotch. I will consult him about your organ.
I believe I told you that I scarcely ever remember
finding my time so little equal to the
claims on it as at this place, though were I
asked 'What are you doing?' I should, alas!
say 'Nothing'; and even, 'What have you
to do?' still the same reply, 'Nothing'. I
have one occupation of an interesting and in
some degree of an embarrassing nature. Soon
after our arrival, I learnt that the only other
inmate of our house was a gentleman who had
been confined to his sofa for many months
from the effects of a rheumatic fever. He had
no friends with him, only a family servant who
attended on him. Naturally feeling for the poor
man, he and ourselves being the only inmates, I
sent a message to him to say that, if agreeable,
I should be happy to wait on him for a few
minutes. He returned an assenting and courteous
reply. Accordingly I called, and found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
a very civil and well-behaved man. I found
that he had been fond of game, and had expressed
his regret that he could not purchase it (this
was his servant's report). Accordingly I sent
him some now and then. I soon afterwards was
told that he was a Roman Catholic. He is by
profession a lawyer at Pontypool. I have since
had several conversations with him, and find
him a decided Roman Catholic, but a man apparently
of great candour and moderation. I was
not surprised to find him strongly prejudiced
against Blanco White.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> 'Oh,' he cried, 'I assure
you, sir, that book is full of the grossest falsehood.'
But I was a good deal surprised to
receive from him an assurance that he had been
reading with great pleasure in a book of my
writing; and I found, to my surprise, that quite
unknown to me Kendal had lent him the book.
I durst not have done it, but the event has
taught me that we may sometimes be too timid
or delicate. Can you suggest any mode of
dealing with my fellow lodger? Hitherto I have
gone on the plan of cultivating his favourable
opinion by general kindness, sending him game,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
&amp;c., and endeavouring to press on him the most
important doctrines of true Christianity and of
showing where the case is really so, that he may
embrace those doctrines and still continue a good
Roman Catholic. There is in the <i>Christian
Observer</i> for September last a critique on Dr.
Whately's sermons by the Bishop of Chichester.
He is said, in the outset, to have stated in a
pamphlet on the Bible Society controversy, that
the only books in the Scriptures which were fit
or useful for general circulation were Genesis,
Exodus, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, I think Isaiah,
but am not sure, the four Gospels, Acts, 1st
Timothy, 1st Peter, 1st John and Jude; all the
rest likely to do more harm than good."</p>


<p>
"<span class="smcap">Bath</span>, <i>December 6, 1831.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"I am unaffectedly sorry for having been apparently
so dilatory in complying with your request
for hymns and tunes. I use the word <i>apparently</i>,
because to any charge of suffering any opportunity
of executing the commission to pass by
unimproved, I may boldly plead not guilty.
There never, surely, was such a place as this for
the frittering away of time. Two visits before
breakfast to the Pump Room, and two again
from 2 to 3-1/4 o'clock in the afternoon, make such
a chasm in the day, that little before dinner
(about 4-3/4) is left for any rational occupation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
Then not being able, for many reasons, to receive
company at dinner, we often invite friends to
breakfast, and as we cannot begin the meal till
10-1/2 at the soonest, we seldom have a clear room
till after 12. Sometimes morning callers come
in before the breakfasters are gone (as has been
the case this morning, when my old friend
Bankes has entered, taking Bath in his way
from his son in North Wales into Dorsetshire).
You owe this account of expenditure of my time
to my feeling quite uncomfortable, from the idea
of neglecting a commission you wished to consign
to me for prompt execution. I will put down in
any letter I may write to you any hymns and
hymn tunes which I like ('Happy the heart
where graces reign,' Lock tune), and you may
add together the <i>disjecta membra</i> into one list.
But I have not hymn-books here except G.
Noel's. At Highwood I have a considerable
number. Your poor mother is worried to pieces
by company and business. I am fully persuaded,
my dear Samuel, that you wish to lighten the
pressure on me as much as possible, and on
the other hand I doubt not you give me full
credit for wishing to make you as comfortable
as I can, and I really hope I shall be able to
go on allowing my children what is necessary for
their comfort."</p>

<p>"St. John says, you will remember, 'I have no
greater joy than to know that my children walk
in the truth.' This he could declare concerning
his figurative children. And well, therefore, ought
we to be able, at least, to desire to feel similar
sensations on witnessing the graces of our true, real
children. And I am in a situation to feel this with
peculiar force. Indeed, I hope I can say with truth
that the more frequent, more continued and closer
opportunities of witnessing your conscientious and
diligent discharge of your pastoral duties&mdash;opportunities
which I probably should not have enjoyed
in the same degree had I still a residence of my
own&mdash;more than compensate all I suffer from the
want of a proper home. Indeed, there are but
two particulars that I at all feel, <i>i.e.</i>, the absence
of my books, and the not being able to practise
hospitality; though that is rather a vulgar word
for expressing my meaning, which is, the pleasure
of receiving those we love under our own roof,
joining with them morning and night in family
prayers, shaking hands with them, and interchanging
continual intercourse of mutual affection.
Well, the time is short, even for those who are
far less advanced than myself in the journey of
life."</p>

or not. We have many a discussion
together, and I now and then stroke his plumage
the wrong way to make him set up his bristles.
He holds the great degeneracy of these times. I,
on the contrary, declared to him that, though I
acknowledged the more open prevalence of profaneness,
and of all the vices which grow out of
insubordination, yet that there had been also a
marked and a great increase of religion within
the last forty years. And as a proof I assigned
the numerous editions of almost all the publications
of family prayers, beginning with the
Rector of St. Botolph's (Bishop of London's)."</p>

<p>"Though I do not like to mention it to your
mother, I feel myself becoming more and more
stupid and inefficient. I think it is chiefly a bodily
disease, at least there, I hope, is the root of the
disease. I am so languid after breakfast that, if
I am read to, I infallibly subside into a drowsiness,
which, if not resisted by my getting up and
walking, or taking for a few minutes the book
Joseph may be reading to me, gradually slides
into a state of complete stupor. Yet it is downright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
shocking in me to use language which may
at all subject me justly to the imputation of
repining. And to be just to myself, I do not
think I am fairly chargeable with that fault. I
hope that which might at first sight seem to have
somewhat of that appearance is rather the compunctious
visitings of my better part grieving
over my utter uselessness. I do not like to give
expression to these distressing risings, because I
may not unreasonably appear to be calling for
friendly assurances in return of my having
been an active labourer. Yet when I am pouring
forth the effusions of my heart to a child to whom
I may open myself with the freedom I may justly
practise towards you, I do not like to keep in
reserve my real feelings. My memory is continually
giving me fresh proofs of its decaying at
an accelerated rate of progress. But I will not
harass your affectionate feelings; and however I
may lament my unprofitableness, and at times
really feel depressed by it, yet my natural cheerfulness
of temper produces in my exterior such
an appearance of good spirits that I might be
supposed by my daily associates to be living in
an atmosphere of unclouded comfort. So you
need not be distressing yourself on my account."</p>

<p>The rest of this letter shows that Wilberforce
had asked the advice of Samuel as to the wisdom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
engaging a Roman Catholic tutor for his grandson
"dear little William."<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Samuel's answer was couched
in decisive terms against this step. Wilberforce,
however, was reconciled to the idea by the knowledge
that "dear little William's mother will be
always on the spot, always on her guard, watchful
and ready to detect and proceed against any
attempt whatever which might be made to bias
William's mind into undervaluing the importance
of the difference between the Roman Catholic
and the Protestant system, or still more to infuse
into his pupil's mind any prejudices against our
principles or personages, or any palliations of the
Popish tenets."</p>

<p>In the concluding year of Wilberforce's life,
though he complains of "becoming more and more
stupid and inefficient," the feelings and thoughts
which animated his life appear in full vigour. His
watchful love for his children, his hospitality, the
steady, faithful looking forward to the life everlasting&mdash;all
are there. Nor, until he has made one
more effort to secure the freedom of the slaves, does
the weary, diligent hand finally "lay down the pen."</p>

<p>"Although we should use great modesty in
speculating on the invisible and eternal world, yet
we may reasonably presume from intimations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
conveyed to us in the Holy Scriptures, and from
inferences which they fairly suggest, that we shall
retain of our earthly character and feelings in that
which is not sinful, and therefore we may expect
(this, I think, is very clear), to know each other,
and to think and talk over the various circumstances
of our lives, our several hopes and fears

probably we shall be enabled to understand the
causes of various events which at the time had
appeared mysterious."</p>

"<i>December 28, 1832.</i><br />
</p>

<p>"I should wish to suggest to you an idea that
arises from a passage in a letter from William
Smith.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The idea is that it might have a very
good effect, for any of my reverend children to be
known to manifest their zeal in the great cause
of West Indian emancipation, and slaves' improvement.
And as I am on that topic let me tell you, I
need not say with how much pleasure, that I really
believe we are now going on admirably. The
slaves will, I trust, be immediately placed under
the government of the same laws as other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
members of the community, instead of being
under the arbitrary commands of their masters,
and (perhaps after a year) they will be still more
completely emancipated. I was truly glad to find
in the evidence taken before the House of Commons'
Committee (which the indefatigable Zachary<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
is analysing), highly honourable testimony to our
friend's (Wildman's) treatment of his slaves. But
I ought not to conceal from you the connection
in which W. Smith's suggestion of the great
benefit that would result from my sons taking a
forward part in befriending the attempts that would
be made to stir up a petitioning spirit in support
of our cause, (for he informed me that efforts
for that purpose would be made). He stated that
it had been observed almost everywhere that the
clergy had been shamefully lukewarm in our cause;
and of course this, which I fear cannot be denied,
has been used in many instances for the injury
of the Church. You and I see plainly how
this has happened: that the most active supporters
of our cause have too often been democrats, and
radicals, with whom the regular clergy could not
bring themselves to associate. Yet even when
subjected to such a painful alternative, to unite
with them, or to suffer the interests of justice and
humanity, and latterly of religion too, to be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
question without receiving any support from them,
or to do violence to, I will not say their prejudices,
but their natural repugnance to appearing to have
anything of a fellow-feeling with men who are
commonly fomenting vicious principles and propositions
of all sorts; when placed, I say, in such
distressing circumstances, they should remember
that their coming forward, in accordance with those
with whom they agree in no other particular, will
give additional weight to their exertions, and prove
still more clearly how strongly they feel the cause
of God, and the well-being of man to be implicated,
when they can consent to take part with those to
whom in general they have been opposed most
strongly. The conduct of the Jamaica people
towards the missionaries has shown of late, more
clearly than ever before, that the spiritual interests
of the slaves, no less than their civil rights, are at
stake. In such a case as this, it is not without
pain and almost shame that I urge any argument
grounded on the interests of the clergy; and yet
it would be wrong to keep considerations of this
sort altogether out of sight, because one sees how
malignantly and injuriously to the cause of religion
the apathy of the clergy may, and will, be used,
to the discredit of the Church, and its most attached
adherents. It is not a little vexatious to find people
so ignorant, as too many are, concerning the real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
state of the slaves, notwithstanding all the pains
that have been taken to enlighten them. Stephen's
book in particular has, I fear, been very little read.
When we were at Lord Bathurst's I saw plainly
that the speeches of a Mr. Borthwick, who had
been going about giving lectures in favour of the
West Indians, had made a great impression on
Lady Georgiana. But I must lay down my pen."</p>
